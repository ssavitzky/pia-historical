<h1>.../pia/pub</h1>

This is the top-level directory for the <em>published</em> software and
documentation generated by members of the PIA Project at CRC.  It is roughly
equivalent to an eventual web site for the PIA.<p>

If you check out a working copy of the <code>pia</code> module, you will get a
copy of this directory into which your makefiles will install things (using
the command <code>make public</code>) after you have worked on them.<p>

<dl>
  <dt> Note:
  <dd> People browsing this directory via the Web will probably not see this
       file, but <code>index.html</code> instead.
