PIA Installation Manual, Alpha release 0.9
==========================================

	This manual describes how to install a Personal Information
	Agency.

I. Obtaining the Files

From Inside Ricoh:

	Telnet or dial in to CRC, and FTP the compressed sources from /pia1/pia.
	There are two versions of the release:

	1)pia_bin.tar.gz, binary only
	2)pia.tar.gz, binary and source
	
From Outside Ricoh:

	(After the product is released, you will be able to) Obtain a copy of
	the public files from ftp://pia.ricoh.com/pub/pia, or browse to the
	public Agency at http://pia.ricoh.com/.

Also Needed

	You will need Java JDKTM 1.0.2 and Jigsaw. The JDK can be obtained from
	http://www.javasoft.com.  Jigsaw is already provided with the PIA library. 

	You also need an operating system that supports sockets and long filenames.
	At the moment we recommend Linux(Red Hat 4.2).

	Unpacking the files requires tar and gunzip (or GNU tar).


II. Installing the Files

At Your Site

	The files are supplied in the form of a gzip'ed tar file. Set your working
	directory to wherever you want the parent directory to be (Let's call this PIA_DIR)
	, and do

	gunzip pia.tar.gz
	tar xf pia.tar

In Your Home Directory

	If you have the binary version goto Setup

Source Control

	If you are planning to do work on the Agency, you should check out a working
	copy into your home directory using CVS. Assuming that the CVS repository is
	in the usual place, /pia1/CvsRoot/, use the following sequence of commands:

	cd ~
	setenv CVSROOT /pia1/CvsRoot
	cvs checkout pia

	(If you're using bash, use

	export CVSROOT=/pia1/CvsRoot

	instead of the setenv).

	You now have a working copy of the PIA. If all you wanted was the source
	code, you can check out pia/src instead of pia.

Setup
	Please go to the pia/bin directory and execute makeconfig.  This creates a pia.props
	(configuration file) for the PIA.  makeconfig will put the file in pia/Config

	You will need a subdirectory of your home directory called "pia".  Within this 
	directory the PIA will write Agents' data.  For example, one of the PIA's agents,
	 History, writes data to a file located in YOUR_HOME_DIR/pia/History.


III. Running the PIA
 
	The executable, pia_wrapper, locates in PIA_DIR/pia/bin.  Its has options which
	you might want to override.  Please read the User's Manual.

	You will probably find it convenient to make a symbolic link called pia in
	/usr/local/bin or wherever you keep your personal binaries. Assuming PIA_DIR
	is /usr/local/pia, you can do this with:

	ln -s /usr/local/pia/bin/pia_wrapper /usr/local/bin/pia


	That's it. Now see the User's Manual to get started.

Peripheral Agencies

If an Agency is started by the special user pia, it configures itself as a
``Peripheral Interface Agency,'' on the assumption that it's being used to
control some peripheral device such as a printer, and also that it might be
being shared among more than one ``real'' user.

Naturally, when Ricoh WebWorts and PIA-based appliances become available,
they will come already configured, with an agency agent customized for
system administration. Until that glorious time, however, you may find
yourself called upon to configure one.
