    VI. Peripheral Agencies

========================================================================

I. Obtaining the Files

   A. From Inside Ricoh

	Connect to CRC via the Internet or direct dialin, and FTP the
	compressed sources from /pia1/pia.  There are two versions of
	the release:

	1)pia_bin.tar.gz, binary only
	2)pia.tar.gz, binary and source
	
   B. From Outside Ricoh

	If and when the PIA is released to the public, it will be
	obtainable from pia.ricoh.com.  The files mentioned above will
	be accessible via FTP in <pia.ricoh.com:/pub/pia>, or HTTP
	via the public Agency at <http://pia.ricoh.com/>.

   C. From CD-ROM
	If you acquire a PIA CD-ROM, it contains the entire, uncompresed PIA directory.

   D. Also Needed

	You will need Java JDK(TM) 1.1.3 or the equivalent.  The JDK can
	be obtained from <http://www.javasoft.com>.  All required code
	outside the JDK is provided with the release.

	You also need an operating system that supports sockets and long
	filenames.  We have tested the PIA on Linux(Red Hat 4.2) on the
	Intel architecture, and Solaris on SPARC.

	Unpacking the files requires tar and gunzip (or GNU tar).

	Several utilities and Agents are written in PERL, and require
	PERL version 5.003 or higher.  PERL can be obtained from the
	CPAN archives at <http://www.perl.com/>

	If you plan to run the PIA on Windows95 without doing any development,
	you can download JRE 1.1.4, the Java runtime environment for "Microsoft
	Windows 95/NT 4.0".  Visit this site:

		http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/jre/index.html

========================================================================
II. Installing the Files

    A. At Your Site

	The files are supplied in the form of a gzip'ed tar file. Set
	your working directory to wherever you want the parent directory
	to be, for example /usr/local/src, and unpack the files:

	  cd /usr/local/src
	  gunzip pia.tar.gz
	  tar xf pia.tar

	This will create a directory pia/ under the working directory.

    B. In Your Home Directory

	  cd ~
	  gunzip pia.tar.gz
	  tar xf pia.tar

	This will create a directory pia/ under your home directory.

    C. From CD-ROM

	  You can run the PIA from the PIA CD.

    D. Under Source Control

	If you are planning to do work on the Agency, you should check
	out a working copy into your home directory using CVS. Assuming
	that the CVS repository is in the usual place, /pia1/CvsRoot/,
	use the following sequence of commands:

	  cd ~
	  cvs -d /pia1/CvsRoot checkout pia


========================================================================
III. Setup

    A. Environment Variables
	The PIA allows you to indicate the location of the installed PIA
	directory.  Its the following with its default value:

	a. For Unix

		PIA_DIR=/usr/local/src/pia

	b. For Windows

		PIA_DIR=<cd-rom-drivename>:\pia

 	Because agents write data to disk, you can specify a directory for storing
	Agent data and customization files.  Below is its directory name with default
	value:

	a. For Unix

		USR_DIR=~/.pia

	b. For Windows
			
		USR_DIR=c:\PIAUSERS\<username>

	Please note that USR_DIR,the directory for storing Agent data, is
	automatically created by the PIA.  If you want a different directory
	please change USR_DIR's value.

	If you use the -u command line option to specify USR_DIR, the directory
	on the command line will take precedence over the one you specify in
	the environment variable.

	Also, if you are proxying through another server, please indicate the
	server like below:

	HTTP_PROXY=http://int-gw.crc.ricoh.com:80/

    B. The default settings of the PIA are contained in 

	  pia/Config/pia.props

	When the PIA starts, it will look for the pia.props under ~./pia/Config.
	You can create a customizable copy in your home directory under
	~/.pia/Config by copying pia/Config/pia.props and modifying it using a text
	editor.

	Please note that if you start the PIA with a -u <userdir> option,
	the PIA will look for the pia.props in <userdir>/Config.

	You will also find it convenient to put the directory "pia/bin"
	into your shell's search path.  


========================================================================
IV. Running the PIA

    A. Starting the program

	a. Under Unix

	   If you have set up the environment variables as mentioned in section III,
	   run the pia with the command:

		  PIA_DIR/bin/pia

	   This is a one-line shell script that runs "pia_wrapper".  A
           complete list of command-line options can be found by running

		  PIA_DIR/bin/pia -?

	b. Under Windows95
		
		Run the pia with the command:
			
		   PIA_DIR/bin/pia.bat

	   This is a batch file that make use of PIA_DIR and USR_DIR environment variables.
	   It is equivalent to the following( Please note the -root and -u options):

		  java -classpath <CPATH> crc.pia.Pia -root <PIAHOME> -u <UHOME>


    B. Using the PIA

	The PIA is essentially a Web server.  Assuming you are running
	a Web browser on the same host as the PIA, simply browse to

	  http://piaHOST:piaPORT/PIA/Doc

	You will eventually want to set your browser's proxies to the
	PIA as well.

    B. Other questions or comments can be sent to pia_bugs@crc.ricoh.com


========================================================================
VI. Peripheral Agencies

	If an Agency is started by the special user pia, it configures
	itself as a ``Peripheral Interface Agency,'' on the assumption
	that it's being used to control some peripheral device such as a
	printer, and also that it might be being shared among more than
	one ``real'' user.

	Naturally, when Ricoh WebWorts and PIA-based appliances become
	available, they will come already configured, with an agency
	agent customized for system administration. Until that glorious
	time, however, you may find yourself called upon to configure
	one.

	Each kind of peripheral is controlled by an Agent which has a
	configuration information in a subdirectory of 

	  pia/Config
