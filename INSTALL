    VI. Peripheral Agencies

========================================================================

I. Obtaining the Files

   A. From Inside Ricoh

	Connect to CRC via the Internet or direct dialin, and FTP the
	compressed sources from /pia1/pia.  There are two versions of
	the release:

	1)pia_bin.tar.gz, binary only
	2)pia.tar.gz, binary and source
	
   B. From Outside Ricoh

	If and when the PIA is released to the public, it will be
	obtainable from pia.ricoh.com.  The files mentioned above will
	be accessible via FTP in <pia.ricoh.com:/pub/pia>, or HTTP
	via the public Agency at <http://pia.ricoh.com/>.

   C. Also Needed

	You will need Java JDK(TM) 1.0.2 or the equivalent.  The JDK can
	be obtained from <http://www.javasoft.com>.  All required code
	outside the JDK is provided with the release.

	You also need an operating system that supports sockets and long
	filenames.  We have tested the PIA on Linux(Red Hat 4.2) on the
	Intel architecture, and Solaris on SPARC.

	Unpacking the files requires tar and gunzip (or GNU tar).

	Several utilities and Agents are written in PERL, and require
	PERL version 5.003 or higher.  PERL can be obtained from the
	CPAN archives at <http://www.perl.com/>

========================================================================
II. Installing the Files

    A. At Your Site

	The files are supplied in the form of a gzip'ed tar file. Set
	your working directory to wherever you want the parent directory
	to be, for example /usr/local/src, and unpack the files:

	  cd /usr/local/src
	  gunzip pia.tar.gz
	  tar xf pia.tar

	This will create a directory pia/ under the working directory.

    B. In Your Home Directory

	  cd ~
	  gunzip pia.tar.gz
	  tar xf pia.tar

	This will create a directory pia/ under your home directory.

    C. Under Source Control

	If you are planning to do work on the Agency, you should check
	out a working copy into your home directory using CVS. Assuming
	that the CVS repository is in the usual place, /pia1/CvsRoot/,
	use the following sequence of commands:

	  cd ~
	  cvs -d /pia1/CvsRoot checkout pia


========================================================================
III. Setup

    A. Environment Variables
	The PIA allows you to indicate the location of the installed PIA
	directory and the directory for storing Agent data and customization files.
	They are the following with their default values:

	PIA_DIR=/usr/local/src
	USR_DIR=~/.pia

    B. If you need to change the default settings of the PIA.  
 	The defaults are contained in 

	  pia/Config/pia.props

	You can create a customizable copy in your home directory under
	~/.pia with the command

	  pia/bin/makeconfig

	You will also find it convenient to put the directory "pia/bin"
	into your shell's search path.  


========================================================================
IV. Running the PIA

    A. Starting the program

	Run the pia with the command:

	  pia/bin/pia

	This is a one-line shell script that runs "pia_wrapper".  A
	complete list of command-line options can be found by running

	  pia/bin/pia -h

	The first time the PIA is run, it will create a directory under
	your home directory:

	  ~/.pia/

	This is used for storing Agent data and customization files.

    B. Using the PIA

	The PIA is essentially a Web server.  Assuming you are running
	a Web browser on the same host as the PIA, simply browse to

	  http://localhost:8888/PIA/Doc

	You will eventually want to set your browser's proxies to the
	PIA as well.

========================================================================
VI. Peripheral Agencies

	If an Agency is started by the special user pia, it configures
	itself as a ``Peripheral Interface Agency,'' on the assumption
	that it's being used to control some peripheral device such as a
	printer, and also that it might be being shared among more than
	one ``real'' user.

	Naturally, when Ricoh WebWorts and PIA-based appliances become
	available, they will come already configured, with an agency
	agent customized for system administration. Until that glorious
	time, however, you may find yourself called upon to configure
	one.

	Each kind of peripheral is controlled by an Agent which has a
	configuration information in a subdirectory of 

	  pia/Config
