README: The Information Agency Alpha release 0.9
==================================================

This is 0.9 (Alpha) release of the Information Agency.
An Information Agency is a kind of proxy web server that provides an
environment for document processing agents.  A Personal Information Agency
sits between you and the rest of the web world, providing a place for agents
which can perform many kinds of tasks for you, such as:
	   * maintain a searchable history of all documents visited
	   * filter advertisements from documents
	   * notify you of changes to interesting documents

A Peripheral Information Agency sits between a device, such as a printer,
and the web, allowing you to access all functions of the device through any
web browser.  Peripheral agents can provide value added features, such as:
	   * formatting web documents for printing on paper
	   * searching a set of digital photographs
	   * automated forms processing

Most importantly, Information Agencies make it very easy to modify and use
new agents using "InterForms" -- Interface Forms that are simple extensions
to HTML.
