<h1>.../pia</h1>

This is the top-level directory for software and documentation generated by
members of the PIA Project at CRC.<p>

The top-level directory <code>/pia1/pia</code> is a CVS-controlled working
directory.  It is mainly intended for work stable enough to be seen outside
the Project; consequently it may not contain the latest-and-greatest version
of anything, but at least it will probably work.<p>

<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Doc.">Doc</a>
  <dd> ``pure'' (non-active) documentation, including working notes.
  <dt> <a href="pub">pub</a>
  <dd> ``Public'' directory.  This is a prototype for the PIA Website; it is
       where you look if you want user documentation or installation packages.
  <dt> <a href="src/">src</a>
  <dd> All source code developed locally by the PIA group, including Agencies,
       Agents, and ``pure'' source code meant to be installed in places like
       <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib</code>.
