<h1>.../pia</h1>

This is the top-level directory for software and documentation generated by
members of the PIA Project at CRC.<p>

The top-level directory <code>/pia1/pia</code> is a CVS-controlled working
directory.  It is mainly intended for work stable enough to be seen outside
the Project; consequently it may not contain the latest-and-greatest version
of anything, but at least it will probably work.<p>

<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Doc/">Doc/</a>
  <dd> ``pure'' (non-active) documentation, including working notes and other
       internal documents.  For use <strong>inside CRC ONLY!</strong>
       Eventually a filtered version will be available outside CRC.
  <dt> <a href="pub/">pub/</a>
  <dd> ``Public'' directory.  This is a prototype for the PIA Website; it is
       where you look if you want user documentation or installation packages.
       (Of course, it's mostly empty at the moment.)  It is expected to
       consist mainly of links to parts of the internal tree.
  <dt> <a href="src/">src/</a>
  <dd> All source code developed locally by the PIA group, including Agencies,
       Agents, and ``pure'' source code meant to be installed in places like
       <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib</code>.
