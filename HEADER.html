<h1>.../pia</h1>

This is the top-level directory for software and documentation generated by
members of the PIA Project at CRC.<p>

The top-level directory <code>/pia1/pia</code> is a CVS-controlled working
directory.  It is mainly intended for work stable enough to be seen outside
the Project; consequently it may not contain the latest-and-greatest version
of anything, but at least it will probably work.<p>

<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Agents/">Agents/</a>
  <dd> Agent InterForms.  Agents used primarily for software development are
       in <a href="src/Agents/">src/Agents/</a>.
  <dt> <a href="Config/">Config/</a>
  <dd> Configuration files for various PIA-based appliances.
  <dt> <a href="Contrib/">Contrib/</a>
  <dd> Contributed software.
  <dt> <a href="Doc/">Doc/</a>
  <dd> ``pure'' (non-active) documentation, including working notes and other
       internal documents, which are <strong>for use inside CRC ONLY!</strong>
       Eventually a filtered version will be available outside CRC.
  <dt> <a href="bin/">bin/</a>
  <dd> Binaries (executable files).  In addition to agencies (most of which
       will be scripts that set environment variables before invoking an
       interpretor), there will be some additional applications here for use
       on WebWorts and other PIA-based appliances. 
  <dt> <a href="lib/">lib/</a>
  <dd> Libraries.  In a development environment, the subdirectories may be
       links into <a href="src/lib/">src/lib/</a>.
  <dt> <a href="pub/">pub/</a>
  <dd> ``Public'' directory.  This is a prototype for the PIA Website; it is
       where you look if you want user documentation or installation packages.
       (Of course, it's mostly empty at the moment.)  It is expected to
       consist mainly of links to parts of the internal tree.
  <dt> <a href="src/">src/</a>
  <dd> All source code developed locally by the PIA group, including Agencies,
       Agents, and ``pure'' source code meant to be installed in places like
       <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib</code>.
