<dl>
  <dt> PIA
  <dd> Platform for Information Appliances, sometimes also used to denote
       Personal Information Agency or Peripheral Information Agency.
  <dt> Information Agency
  <dd> The core computation on which Agents run.  It includes all the
       functions for sending and receiving electronic documents.
  <dt> Agent
  <dd> A software object that maintains state  and performs some
       specific task.  Agent functions are accessed through a 
       set of Web pages (InterForms).  In most cases, creating agent requires
       little more than authoring this set of documents.
  <dt> InterForm
  <dd> (Interface Form) Term for a Web page (electronic form) used as an
       interface to an agent.  Typically written in HTML with some special
       tags (the InterForm language) which are interpreted by the agency
       before a page is sent to the user. 
  <dt> InterForm language
  <dd> An extensible set of markup tags that allows Web page authors to access
       functions on the Information Agency.  Conforming to XML specifications,
       these tags make it easy for authors to create useful agents.
  <dt> Network Office Appliance
  <dd> A new kind of office machine that is connected to electronic Network,  shared
       among a group of users in an Office, and works so simply that you
       <em>already know how to use it</em>.
