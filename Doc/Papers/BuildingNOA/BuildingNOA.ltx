\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

An Information Appliance differs significantly from a personal computer in
 ease of installation and maintenance, intended usage, and training
 costs.  Network Office Appliances represent an important class of
 Information Appliances.  A Network Office Appliance (NOA) connects to the
 network, is shared among a group of users, and works so simply that You
 Already Know How To Use It (YAKHUI). 

\latexonly{

conventional PCs and Network Office Appliances.}  For
 %\SEE{http://rsv.ricoh.com}{sbc}{the Strategic Business Center}.  For
demonstrations of prototype NOA's \SEE{PIA/Doc/demos.html}{the PIA demos}.

Users control and access network appliances (and other servers) through a web browser.
All functions, options, and  documentation appear embedded in web pages
(HTML documents) that can be viewed on any display.  These pages constitute a
{\it Network User Interface} for the appliance.  In contrast with the
``Desktop'' metaphor of Graphical User Interfaces, the Network User
Interface  uses a document metaphor.
The primitive state of design principles and tools for developing
Network User Interfaces poses a difficult challenge for network appliance
developers. 


This document describes a reusable design or ``Framework''  that can reduce
the difficulty and speed up the development of Network Office Appliances.  This framework reduces time-to-market by enabling developers to
rapidly do the prototyping and user testing needed to create
effective Network User Interfaces while simultaneously developing working hardware.
NOA's built using this framework  have a number of other features which
  provide additional customer value and reduce life cycle costs.  Each
device can easily be customized for a particular niche or customer, and
customer service and support can be automatically delivered over the Internet.

must maintain.  NOA is ``closed box'' no dependencies across box boundaries.}

\subsection{PIA -- Peripheral Information Agency}
% diagram of relationship between IA, NOA, PC
A computational {\bf Platform} provides a means for creating and running
user level applications.  Conventional computer platforms, such as
Microsoft's Windows,  support the creation of {\it Graphical User
Interfaces}.   Sharing this
infrastructure across applications reduces development time and improves
usability.

A Peripheral Information Agency provides a means for creating and running
 networked appliances which users access through a web browser. The PIA
 supports the creation of {\it Network User Interfaces} with a core set of
 functions for handling HTTP requests and manipulating documents.
 Like conventional platforms, sharing this
infrastructure reduces development time and improves the reliability and
 usability of network appliances.

 Applications on the PIA platform are called ``Agents'' because they typically
 engage in a dialog with users, sending a sequence of pages in response to
 user requests.  As explained below, most Agents can be created by authoring
 HTML documents without the need for programming.

\section{Fax Management Appliance}
\label{sec:FMA}
A proposed ``Fax Management Appliance'' (FMA) serves to illustrate our design
principles for Network Office Appliances.  Based on a standard fax machine
(a very successful office appliance), the FMA converts faxes into electronic
documents and vice versa, allowing users to view or send them using a web
browser.  The FMA also provides means for managing those documents, such as
grouping together all correspondence with a particular customer, or all
communications/versions of a particular document.

The  PIA reference implementation comes with an example
\textsf{\textbf{FMA}} agent to illustrate the basic principles of agent design.
Figure \ref{fig:fma1.home} shows a screen shot of the FMA home page.  On a
running agency you can view the \IFcode{FMA} home page live.  (Clicking on
\textsf{\textsl{(source)}} will provide a listing of all the InterForms
associated with this agent.)  InterForms described in Section \ref{sub:interforms}  are HTML documents which act as
scripts for agents.

\section{Architecture Overview}
\label{sec:arch}
 Each NOA connects to the network and acts as both a client and a server.
 User's interact with the NOA through any web browser. Depending on the
 device, some or all functions may also be available through the front
 panel\footnote{Front panel requests can always be mapped into
 corresponding HTTP requests.}.


\FIGs{arch}{Diagram of NOA architecture. The Agents running on the
Information Agency provide the Network User Interface.  For prototyping, the
Information Agency (a kind of web server) and the Hardware Unit may be physically located in
separate boxes.}

 Internally, the NOA consists of the two main parts shown in Figure
 \ref{fig:arch}. The ``Information Agency'' provides functions similar to
 conventional web servers,
 responding to user requests and maintaining the document database.
 The ``Hardware Unit'' which performs some task (e.g. printer engine,
 scanner, etc.) similar to today's peripherals\footnote{Peripherals differ
 from NOA in determining system boundaries.  Peripherals generate / consume
 data which must be interpreted by some application before being useful.
 Customers are responsible for maintaining the proper link between
 application and peripherals (an {\bf open-box} solution).  In contrast,
 NOA's generate documents which customers can use directly (a {\bf
 closed-box} solution).}.
 During prototyping, these two parts may be located in separate boxes.  The
 Information Agency box (called a ``WebWort'') plugging into the network and
 communicating with the Hardware Unit via proprietary channels (e.g. a
 WebPrinter Agency connected by parallel port to a printer).


As
shown in Figure \ref{fig:process}, the Information Agency handles all user
(HTTP) requests.  The agency routes each request to the appropriate agent
which uses an InterForm to generate a response.  Thus the agents along with
their InterForms  constitute the Network User Interface.  Section
\ref{sub:agents} describes  the general procedure for creating
agents, while section \ref{sub:interforms} describes authoring InterForms.  


\FIG{process}{Agents on the Information Agency handle requests differently
 than conventional web servers.  Web servers typically return static files
 to a user or run a separate program to generate responses.  Agents provide
 a simpler and more flexible scheme.  For most requests, an agent
 retrieves an interform, interpret any special tags, and  pass the
 results back to the user.  Unlike conventional servers, agents maintain
 data (``state'') across connections allowing several InterForms to access
 the same data without relying on client side services.}


 The Information Agency scales from small, resource limited devices to full scale
 supercomputers and does not specify a particular hardware architecture or
 operating system.
 Typically the computational resources needed will be dictated by the
 Hardware Unit and the core PIA system will be ported to that computational
 environment.  This core requires a network interface,  a small amount of
 process memory, and access to static memory for the InterForms.  Ports to C
 environments should be straightforward.  

The PIA group provides a reference
 implementation  Information Agency written in Java along with assistance
 for porting the core functions to other
 environments.  Any computer can run this reference implementation and be
 used to prototype the  Network User Interface.  Because of the wide range of hardware
 environment, the interaction between the Information Agency and the
 Hardware Unit must be determined on a case by case basis\footnote{The
 framework does provide some guidelines for this interaction.  However the
 main determining factor will be the hardware port.   In some cases, the
 systems will communicate via the document storage.  In other cases, agents
 will be extended to communicate via system calls.  See \ref{sub:hi}}.

\subsection{Information Agency components}

%\FIG{arch}{Diagram of Information Agency Component}

\begin{description}
\item[Agents] Software objects which respond to user requests and manipulate
documents.  Roughly analogous to applications except that all
 user interaction takes place through a sequence of HTTP requests and
responses. See Section \ref{sub:agents}, \TOP{Doc/Tutorial}{Tutorial}, \MAN{Author} , and
\Jclass{pia}{Agent}.
\item[InterForms] Since all user interaction happens through HTTP requests,
the {\bf user interface} consists of a set of HTML {\bf forms}.   Rather
than write programs to generate these HTML documents, developers simply
create standard HTML documents which we call InterForms ({\bf Inter}face {\bf
Forms}). For most user requests, an agent retrieves the appropriate
InterForm and sends it to the user.  In addition to standard HTML tags,
InterForms include a number of special tags which instruct the agent to
perform various actions.  For example,  an agent would interpret:
{\tt <sum> 23 42  </sum> }  
 as an instruction to insert the  sum of {\tt 23} and {\tt 42} (e.g. {\tt
65} into the HTML document that
is being sent back to the user.  See  Section \ref{sub:interforms}, the \MAN{InterForm}, examples \IFcode{FMA/home.if},
\IFcode{FMA/send.if},  and the interpreter \Jclass{interform}{Handle},
\Jclass{interform}{Interp}.
\label{InterForms}
\item[Document storage]  Stores information about documents in the system.
May also store the electronic versions of documents themselves, or pointers to documents stored
elsewhere on the network. For simplicity, the reference implementation uses
the underlying file system. See Section \ref{sub:docs} and example \DATA{FMA/incoming}.
\item[HardwareInterface] Many appliances include some special hardware, for
example a fax modem. This interface allows agents to send instructions to
the  hardware, or for the hardware to send messages to agents or add to the
document storage.  Generally, input devices (scanners) simply add documents to the
database. See  Section \ref{sub:hi}, and \TOP{Config}{Configuration directory}  for setting up
processes and \Jclass{interform}{Handle} for getting access from within
InterForms.

\end{description}

 \subsection{Office Architecture}
 Eventually offices will include several NOA's and other information
 resources. Most offices will have a central directory and resources guide
 with pointers to other servers within the organization and
 NOA's as shown in Figure \ref{fig:lahoo}.
This repository may also provide search, archiving, and backup
 functions across these resources.  Conventions for these operations will
 develop over time and be incorporated into the PIA framework.
\FIGs{lahoo}{Eventually offices will have several information servers
 maintained by different parts of the organization.  A corporate home page will provide
 links and guides to the other resources.  A separate NOA
 (often called a Document Management Appliance) may provide search, archive, and
 backup functions for other resources.  Most resources will include links to
 external sites (not shown).}

Agents communicate through HTTP requests, allowing them to work together.
For example, a Photo\_Album agent may send photos to the CD-RW agent for
creating a photo CD.


\section{Steps to Building a NOA}
\label{sec:steps}
To create a Network Office Appliance, two separable components must be
developed, the Network User Interface and the Information Agency.
Developing these
components requires very different skills.  


 Developing the user interface requires a combination of technical writing,
 graphic design, and user testing skills to construct the set of web pages
 (InterForms) that the users see.  Some programming skills may be required
 to extend agents to provide additional functions not currently supported in
 the core agency.

 The Information Agency runs on top of some computational architecture.  For
 initial development, a conventional PC running the PIA reference
 implementation (Section \ref{sub:refimp} may be used.
 For the delivered product, the core functions of the agency must be ported
 to the target architecture as described in section \ref{sub:hard}.
 This step can be done been parallel with the user interface development to reduce the time to market.

 Porting the PIA core to the target hardware requires standard software
 engineering skills. Normally this work would be performed by the group
 responsible for software components (OS, controller, protocol handlers) of
 the device.  Porting can be done either by implementing the core functions
 in native code, or providing a Java run-time environment on which the
 reference implementation can run.  This group should also determine and
 implement the Hardware Interface\footnote{Note that since this group
 controls both sides of this interface, the development task should be
 considerably easier and more flexible than traditional interfaces where the
 device driver resides on the PC.}.


\subsection{Prototyping}

 Prototyping the Network User Interface should begin as early as  possible.
 Because of the novelty of the linked document as user interface, several rounds of user
 testing will be necessary to construct an effective and clear interface.


\subsubsection{PIA reference implementation}
\label{sub:refimp}
The PIA reference implementation can be used for prototyping (with or
without the hardware backend).  The reference implementation written in Java
 should run on most computers and has been tested on Unix and Windows95. 
 Contact the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{PIA group}{\PIA} to obtain a copy.

 A running PIA looks like a web server.  By default it should be accessible
 to any web browser through port {\tt 8888}.
 If you have a PIA running, this document should be available at
 \htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://localhost:8888/PIA/Doc/Papers/BuildingNOA/}}{http://localhost:8888/Doc/Papers/BuildingNOA/} where {\tt localhost} is the name of machine the PIA is running  on.
The port number, host name, and many other properties can be modified with
 command line arguments or through the \TOP{Config/pia.props}{properties
 file}.

See the \MAN{Install} for more information and configuration information.


\subsubsection{Agent(s)}
\label{sub:agents}

The NOA network user interface development proceeds by creating a new agent
tailored to the specific functions of the appliance.  
 Agents are persistent software objects that exist on the Information Agency.
 Agents handle (HTTP) requests made to the agency, typically by locating the
 appropriate InterForm, interpreting it, and sending the results back to the
 user.  Most requests specify a particular agent directly in the url, for
 example \URL{FMA/home.if} specifies a request for the home page of the FMA
 agent.

 Agent objects get created during start-up by the \Jcode{crc.pia.Pia}{main
 PIA program}.  In
 the development system, a special agent called ``Agency'' gets instantiated
 by default.  This agent in turn reads the file
 \TOP{Agents/Agency/START-UP.html} and instantiates the agents listed
 there.  On a running agency, agent objects can be created  dynamically through the
 \IFcode{Agency/installers.if}.

Agents have both a name and a type.  By convention agent names should begin
with a capital letter.  In most cases the agent name and type will be
identical.   Sometimes different agents will share the same functions but
operate on different data, for example, each instance of the
\TOP{Agents/DOFS}{Document Oriented Filing System (DOFS)} operates on a different
file hierarchy.  These agents have the same type, but different names.  Table \ref{tab:agents}
lists the agents provided with the standard PIA reference implementation
distribution.
\begin{table}
\caption{Agents provided with the standard PIA development distribution
(reference implementation)}
\label{tab:agents}
\begin{tabular}{llrc}
Name & Type & Home Page & Description \\ \hline
Agency &  Agency &\IFcode{Agency/home.if}  & Oversees and installs other agents \\
FMA & FMA &\IFcode{FMA/home.if}  & Demonstration Fax Management Appliance  \\
PIA & DOFS & \IFcode{PIA/home.if} & Serves files in the PIA distribution
directory \\
MY & DOFS & \IFcode{MY/home.if} & Serves files in the data directory  \&usrDIR;\\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

 If the agency has access to a class corresponding to the specified type of
 an agent, the agent object will be an instantiation of that class.  By
 default, agent objects are instantiations of the
 \Jclass{pia}{GenericAgent}.   This section describes the standard
 behavior of these GenericAgent types. \footnote{\Jclass{pia}{Agent} is an
 interface.  Software engineers may create agents with almost any kind of
 behavior.  In practice, functions  specific to a given agent will generally
 be implemented by subclassing GenericAgent.}

 Agent names and types serve to specify the location of an agents InterForm
 and data  objects.  On the development system these objects are stored in
 files.  Data files are located in the \&usrDIR; which by default is
 $\tilde{}$/.pia, but can be changed by setting {\tt crc.pia.usrroot} in the
  \TOP{Config/pia.props}{property file} or using the {\tt -d} command line flag.
 \&usrDIR;/FMA specifies the directory for the \DATA{FMA}.

 InterForms are located in the \TOP{Agents/}{Agents} directory.  Agents look for
 InterForms first in a subdirectory corresponding to their name, then a
 subdirectory corresponding to their type, then in the Agents directory.  On
 the development system, if the directory \&usrDIR;/Agents exists then
 agents will look for InterForms in that directory before using the
 \TOP{Agents/}{Agents} directory.  This provides a very simple type of InterForm
 inheritance that makes it extremely quick easy to  customize the  behavior
 of agents.  Figure \ref{fig:ifInherit} shows this lookup process.
\FIG{ifInherit}{To facilitate rapid development and customization, agents
 look in several places for requested InterForms. First agents look in the
 user directory {\tt usrDIR} for local modifications, then they look in the standard
 Agents distribution directory {\tt piaDIR} under both the agents Name and
 Type.  If no InterForm is found, any default in the ``Agents'' directory is
 used.}



In addition to the
device specific InterForms,  each agent should
provide the standard set of InterForms:
 \begin{itemize}
\item\IFcode{home.if} The home page for the appliance which includes links
to major functions and Ricoh support sites.
\item\IFcode{index.if} Should list all functions available in terse format.
\item \IFcode{about.inc} should provide a summary description of the
appliance to be included in other InterForms.
\item \IFcode{initialize.if}  Should initialize any data structures --
 this form is automatically accessed  by the agency when creating the agent
 object.
\item \IFcode{archive.if} Should return a list of links, the contents of
which constitute a snapshot of the data of this agent-- used by other systems
 for creating system wide backups and directories.
 \end{itemize}(These can be inherited from the \TOP{Agents}{Agents directory}.)


\FIG{fma1.home}{A screen shot of the FMA home page as a user might see it. Figure \ref{fig:fma.if} shows the
 corresponding InterForm. The arrows
represent links to other InterForms.  }

The fax management agent includes InterForms for sending faxes, viewing
received faxes, and viewing fax correspondence organized in various ways.
Faxes to be sent can be specified by URL, in which case the agent first
retrieves the document and renders it for faxing, or ``up-loaded'' to the agent
using the browser.
Both received and sent faxes  can be searched and viewed in several ways, for example by
date (using a calendar), by phone number, by account, etc. 
  Most NOA's will have similar InterForms for viewing their document
databases.   These views should be appropriate to the customer tasks, and
may eventually use document analysis to provide, for example, views showing
versions of the same document.



 See the  the following section, and the \TOP{Doc/Tutorial}{Tutorial} \MAN{Author}
 for more information on  developing InterForms.   

In addition to
 InterForms, new classes of agents may be created by extending the
 \Jclass{pia}{GenericAgent} class or creating entirely new classes which
 implement the \Jclass{pia}{Agent}  interface.   These functions usually
 provide back-end support for features accessible through InterForms.  See
 section \ref{sub:hi} for more information on implementing new agent classes.
Figure \ref{fig:agents} shows part of the agent class hierarchy.


\subsubsection{InterForms}
\label{sub:interforms}
 Agents treats HTTP requests differently than conventional web servers.
 Most web servers treat HTML documents as static files.
 When a user requests a document, the server retrieves the file and sends it
 as the response.  When a user fills out a form, the server starts a new
 program (called a CGI script) and pipes the data to it.  The output of the
 CGI program gets sent back to the user.\footnote{CGI scripts were the first
 and most popular means for processing form data.  Many web servers today
 allow other types of processing, mostly for reasons of efficiency.  The
 Java web server introduced the notion of servlets which are similar to our
 agents, but still require programming.}  Creating the CGI script or
 modifying the form processing requires programming skills and usually an
 entirely different development environment from creating HTML pages.

In contrast, agents do not require any separate programs for processing
forms.  The HTML documents themselves contain special tags which instruct
the agent on how to process the forms.  These documents, called InterForms
(Inteface Forms), reduce the time and effort to create and maintain Network
User Interfaces.  All development can be done using HTML authoring tools
without software programming.  
Figure \ref{fig:process} illustrates the processing differences between
conventional servers and the Information Agency.

 Agents respond to requests by locating the appropriate InterForm,
 interpreting the contents, and sending the result as the response.
 InterForms are standard HTML documents with an extended set of tags,
  such as {\tt get, repeat,  sort}.
 Most tags will be passed to the browser as normal.  Some tags cause
 the agent to perform an action.  For example, when an agent sees {\tt <get
 name=''data''>} it will insert the contents of the variable {\tt foo} into
 the response, where {\tt foo} might be the name of in form input field. {\tt <sort> 2 1 3 </sort> } will put {\tt 1 2 3 } in the
 response. Agents also perform entity (like variables) substitution.
An entity is enclosed between an ampersand and semi-colon.  Entities will be replaced by the corresponding
 value,  e.g. 
 {\tt  \&agentName;} by {\tt FMA} in the response.
 In this way, InterForms act like a scripting language for agents.


 The InterForm interpreter provides many tags for manipulating documents and
agents, and a means for dynamically extending the set of tags. The FMA home
page InterForm in Figure \ref{fig:fma.if} shows a few of these tags.  For a
complete list of tags see the
\MAN{InterForm} and the InterForm demonstration agent:
\IFcode{InterForm/demo.if}
\IFcode{InterForm/entities.if}.


\begin{figure}

 HTML documents and InterForms  conform to the 
 SGML\footnote{Standard Generalized Markup Language is an international
 standard for document types.  HTML documents are a type of SGML documents that conform to the HTML
 Document Type Definition (DTD).  The InterForm system extends the HTML DTD
 and could work with any other type of SGML document given the proper
 \Jcode{crc.sgml.Tagset}.} specification with which most technical writers should be
 familiar.  All of the editing tools and support for SGML documents should
 apply to creating InterForms.

 In developing the PIA demonstrations, several conventions have been
 observed to improve the look and feel of the documents and aid in
 maintainability.
\begin{itemize}
\item The home page  should include links to major functions, as well as the
product support site,\IFcode{FMA/home.if}
\item  Commonly used pieces, such as headers and footers should be stored in
separate files with a {\tt .inc} extension and included in documents using
the
{\tt <read interform file=XXX.inc process>} tag.
\IFcode{FMA/heading.inc}\IFcode{FMA/footing.inc}
\item The actions to take on submission of a form should be embedded in a
process tag inside a form,
{\tt <form action=''\&url''> ... <process> ACTIONS </process> </form>}
\item Graphics should be stored in an {\tt Icons} subdirectory of the agents
InterForm directory.
\item Absolute urls of the form {\tt http://\&piaHOST;\&piaPORT;/\&agentName;/XXX}
should be used when possible. This allows users to store and modify the pages
that they view, while maintaining portability of the InterForm sources
across agencies and agent names.
\item  The collection of an agent's InterForms should be maintained using a
version control system. (The PIA group uses CVS.)
\end{itemize}
 Over time, design principles and guides for Network User Interfaces should
 be established.

\subsubsection{Document Processing and Storage}
\label{sub:docs}
 Most network office appliances will process and store documents of one type or
another.  The nature, size, and implementation of this storage will vary
across appliances.  All implementations should be able to store the contents
of  documents along any meta-data, such as a of creation and source.
 The reference implementation uses a simple file system structure for
storing documents. The data directory for each agent contains a subdirectory
for each type of document.  For example, in the FMA agent, the
\DDIR{FMA/incoming}{incoming} and \DDIR{FMA/outgoing}{outgoing} directories
contain the incoming and outgoing faxes.  Within each directory documents
are stored in a unique location corresponding to current date, so a fax sent
on Sept.12, 1997 at 10 a.m. would be stored in a directory {\tt
FMA/outgoing/1997/09/12/10:00/}. Files in that directory would include the
contents {\tt fax.tif} and additional meta data {\tt XXX}.

 By default,  file names within an InterForm are relative to the agents data
 directory, so {\tt <read file=FMA/outgoing/1997/09/12/10:00/XXX>} would
 read in the meta data file above.  For convenience, urls beginning with
 {\tt /$\tilde{}$AGENTNAME/} also map to the agents data directory, so \\
{\tt
 <a
 href=``http://\&piaHOST;:\&piaPORT;/$\tilde{}$\&agentName;/outgoing/1997/09/12/10:00/fax.tif''>} in an FMA agent InterForm would generate a link to the
 above fax.

 Within an InterForm, SGML documents can be treated as data structures.
 Imagine setting the variable foo to the contents of Ricoh's home page:{\tt
 <set name=foo><read href=``http://www.ricoh.com/''></set>}. The various
 pieces of foo can now be accessed using the get tag: {\tt <get
 name=``foo.head.title''>}  would return the title (if any) of the document
 assuming the canonical html structure {\tt <head><title>DOCUMENT
 TITLE</title></head>}.  For convenience, entity substitutions  can normally
 be used in place of the get tag, e.g.{\tt
 \&foo.head.title;}.

Agents provide a convenient mechanism for storing data/documents. {\tt <set
agent name=foo>CONTENTS</set> } sets a variable foo that can be accessed by
any other InterForms as {\tt <get agent name=foo>} or more simply {\tt
\&AGENT.foo;}.  Likewise the data associated with a form submission is
available within the interform as {\tt <get  form name=foo>} or
{\tt \&FORM.foo;} where {\tt  foo} is the name of an input field in the
form.

Agents should provide mechanisms for searching the document database through
the get tag.  For example,{\tt <get agent name=DATA contains=''keyword''>}
should return  all documents containing the {\tt keyword}.  Standardized
mechanisms and the query interface are under development.  See  the
 documentation for the \Jcode{crc.interform.handler.Set}{Set} and
\Jcode{crc.interform.handler.Get}{Get} tag handlers.



\subsubsection{Hardware Interface}
\label{sub:hi}
 The PIA framework does not specify a single means for interaction between
 the information agency and the hardware unit.  Depending upon the core
 implementation, this interaction may take one of several forms.  In the
 simplest case, the systems share the document repository.  Documents
 captured by the hardware are added to the proper location in the
 repository.  InterForms access these documents in the normal manner.  The
 \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Photo\_Album}{http://photo.crc.ricoh.com:8001/}
 prototype operates in this manner.  When a memory card is inserted, photos
 are automatically copied into the photo database for future retrieval by
 agents.  The {\tt latest} link is updated to point to that location.

A second method allows InterForms to control hardware functions through
special tags, for example {\tt <status>} might insert a string
 representing the status of the hardware. Implementation of these tags
should be done by extending\Jclass{interform}{Handler}. (Also see the
standard \Jcode{crc.interform.handler}{handler} package.) During development, the{\tt
<define-actor>} tag may be used define a tag to mimic the designed behavior.

For more complex interactions, developers may create a new class of agents,
either by extending the \Jclass{pia}{GenericAgent} or creating a new class
which extends the \Jclass{pia}{Agent} interface.  In this case, responses
to certain types of requests might be generated directly by the agent
without any responding InterForm.  During development,  the behavior could
be mimicked by InterForms for testing purposes.



\subsection{User Testing}
\label{sub:usertests}

Active documents such as InterForms present a new set of challenges for
information designers. These documents serve both as the user manual and the
Network User Interface for the appliance.  Pages will be viewed on a wide variety of displays,
and must afford efficient access to the primary functions.  User
participation and testing
will be critical to developing successful systems.
Several iterations of developing and testing the prototype
 should be performed.

Informal testing of the interface should begin soon after InterForm
development starts.  Initial prototypes (usually consisting of separate
information agency and hardware unit boxes) should be placed in customer
sites as soon as possible.   In addition to normal user interviews, the \IFcode{History} and \IFcode{Bug} agents can be used to track
accesses and provide feedback on the usability of interface.
See Figure \ref{fig:Usertests} for an example timeline.

 Since development consists mainly of editing HTML documents, the InterForm
 developer can respond almost immediately to user concerns and requests for
 changes.   Part of the initial customer testing might include the developer
 spending a few days on site customizing the system.  Integrating the
 changes made across all customers should result in a superior system.

\FIG{Usertests}{Proposed project timeline}

\subsection{Hardware / Software Development}
\label{sub:hard}
 The PIA framework does not specify a particular computational
 architecture.  It does provide a means for cleanly separating the Network
 User Interface from the system hardware allowing parallel development
 efforts. The choice of hardware platform and operating system will normally
 be dictated by the hardware unit.  

\subsubsection{PIA core implementation}
The software developers should be
 responsible for supplying the core PIA functions on the target system.
These include basic network transport along with the \Jcode{crc.pia.Agent}{Agent}, \Jcode{crc.pia.Content}{Content}, \Jcode{crc.pia.Transaction}{Transaction}, \Jcode{crc.pia.Machine}{Machine}, and \Jcode{crc.pia.Resolver}{Resolver} interfaces and data structures.

The core functions may be supported either by porting the  above classes to
the target system or by supplying a Java run time environment for the PIA
reference implementation.\footnote{Sun Microsystems has announced plans for
 system components for embedded devices such as NOA's.  These include Java
OS, Embedded Java, and the Java chipset.  See
\htmladdnormallink{http://java.sun.com/}{http://java.sun.com/}}



In addition to the core functions, some
NOA's may provide  additional processing capabilities.  For
example, a ``Document Management Appliance'' (DMA) may provide OCR
functions.  These functions should be added to the information agency by
extending existing agents or implementing new ones.  Figure \ref{fig:agents}
shows the agent class hierarchy.

\FIGs{agents}{The agent class hierarchy.  Instances of \Jcode{crc.pia.GenericAgent}{GenericAgent} respond
to requests using InterForms.   New classes of agents normally extend this
class.  For example the DMA agent might support OCR.  Classes which do not
use InterForms, for example a Security agent, implement
the \Jcode{crc.pia.Agents}{Agents} interface directly.}

In porting the PIA core, the software developers should also provide the
 hardware interface between the information agency and the hardware unit.
 See \ref{sub:hi} for more details.

 In cases where the PIA port does not include an InterForm interpreter or to
 conserve storage and improve performance, source InterForms can be compiled
 to an internal format.   Using an appropriately defined
 \Jclass{interform}{Tagset}, the reference implementation can be
 configured to generate the appropriately compiled InterForms for the target
 system, and the \textsf{\textsl{GenericAgent}} class should be
 appropriately modified.

 Please contact the PIA group for assistance in porting the core to your
 target hardware.  The PIA group will maintain the most current reference
 implementation and attempt to ensure consistency, compatibility, and
 code reuse among different ports.


\section{Cost of Goods and Other Considerations}
\label{sec:add}
 The PIA framework has implications for the other steps in the life cycle of
 an NOA.

\begin{description}

\item[Cost of Goods]   The PIA framework itself should not  substantially affect the costs of
 goods.  Any NOA will require the same set of minimal hardware
 (processing, storage).  The services provided, e.g. size of document store
 or image processing capabilities,
 will have the biggest impact on costs.
 Relative to existing peripherals, NOA's may require more process memory and
 long term storage (and of course a network interface.)

\item[Manufacture] A diagnostic agent could be developed which assists in
 the  quality assurance process.

\item[Installation] NOA devices should require no installation effort by the
user.  After plugging the NOA into the power and data networks, the system
should  configure itself.  This includes auto detection of network type, host
name (e.g. DHCP), etc. Default parameters may be changed through
administration InterForms.

\item[Maintenance]  One of the agents on the delivered system should be
responsible for monitoring the status of the device.  It may automatically
fix some problems (e.g. archiving files when storage gets tight), and alerts
users and / or the product support center for others.  It would also provide
data to remote diagnostic systems.   Each NOA product line should have an
associated technical support web site for communication with customers and these
diagnostic agents.


\item[Business models]   The many experiments currently underway on the
Internet and Intranets will eventually lead to some successful business models.
The flexibility of the Network User Interface
developed in the PIA framework will enable NOA's to take advantage of these
business models.   For example, targeted advertising could be included in
the interface.  At the least, the brand name will constantly be displayed
and customers will always have a ``one-click'' path to contact the provider.

\end{description}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

For Network Office Appliances the user manual {\bf is} the user interface.
Technical writers / Information designers should be responsible for
developing this Network User Interface which should undergo several rounds
of user testing.  The interface runs on top of an Information Agency  which
should be ported to the target hardware platform by traditional software
engines.

 This structured method for building the Network
 User Interface to Network Office Appliances provides a rapid
 prototyping environment for reducing development time and improving
 quality.   Separating the user interface from hardware allows parallel
 development and testing.  The skills and procedures scale across a broad range of product lines resulting in
 lower life cycle costs and improved ability to deliver value added solutions.



\section{Appendix: PIA development}
\label{app:pia}
 The PIA group started at Ricoh's California Research Center in January 1997
 with the charter of producing Platforms for Information Appliances.  The
 primary activity has been developing the reference implementation of the
 Information Agency.  Originally built in perl, the system was ported to
 Java and substantially improved during the first half of 1997.

Several demonstration appliances have been created and are in daily use
 around CRC.  These include both Peripheral Information Agencies (\htmladdnormallinkfoot{Photo\_Album}{http://photo.crc.ricoh.com:8001},
 \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Forms processor}{http://forms.crc.ricoh.com:8000},
and the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{PIA web site}{http://pia.crc.ricoh.com:8888})
 and  Personal Information Agencies (\htmladdnormallinkfoot{Steve's PIA}{http://gelion.crc.ricoh.com:8888},
 \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Greg's PIA}{http://ookami.crc.ricoh.com:8888})
 which act as proxy servers for their owners providing many enhanced web
 functions.

 The on-line version of this document should be available on
 \htmladdnormallinkfoot{the PIA web site}{http://pia.crc.ricoh.com:8888/Doc/Papers/BuildingNOA/BuildingNOA}  and is supplied with a distribution of the PIA reference implementation.
