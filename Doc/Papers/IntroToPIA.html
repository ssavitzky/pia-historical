<abstract>
The PIA framework provides the infrastructure for rapidly creating and maintaining value added
services in a network environment.   Example services include simple hot-list ("favorites") management, high-quality printing of Web
documents, and workflow/document management systems. Oftentimes these services
 integrate information for multiple sources, operate on the information, and
 provid the results to a user or community.  Thus they lie between the servers
 and clients of the traditional network computing paradigms.
Recognizing  that such systems are not supported by current tools, we created
a platform for building and running these intermediary services.  The services
are characterized as "information appliances", hence the name of the
framework: Platform for Information Appliances.


This document summarizes the features of the PIA framework and provides a guide
to the more detailed documentation.
