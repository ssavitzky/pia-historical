<abstract>
The PIA framework can provide a long-term competitive advantage to
Ricoh by reducing the time to market and the life-cycle costs across
the range of next generation office machines known as "Information
Appliances." 
This document summarizes the features of the PIA framework and provides a guide
to the more detailed documentation.
</abstract>

The PIA framework provides the infrastructure for rapidly creating and maintaining value added
services in a network environment.   Example services include high-quality printing of Web
documents, forms processing, and document management systems. 
These services may be bundled into a hardware product called a 
Network Office Appliance, such as the File Management Appliance or the
Memory Multifunction Machine (prototypes currently being developed by
groups within Ricoh) or appear as more general "Information Appliances."

<p>

These systems differ from traditional applications in several ways.
Most importantly, they perform  both server functions (providing data
to clients) and client functions (retrieving data from other servers).
For example, a File Management Appliance takes documents from several
sources (scanners, copiers, Web servers, PC's, etc.)and provides an
easy-to-use interface to find, use, and publish those documents.
  They represent a new kind of "middleware" that lies
  between traditional servers and clients.  To be successful, they
  require a robust computational engine on which to run and the
  knowledge about how to integrate and process information to meet
  customer needs.   The ability to create, maintain, and deploy
  this knowledge will become the key factor for successful office machines.

<p>

Our Platform for Information Appliances (PIA) seeks to provide both
a standardized computational engine and a reusable design for the
knowledge components. this design separates the knowledge into task
specific modules  called "Agents."   Alternatively known as
"Mediators" or "Facilitators" these agents embody the  knowledge
needed to take information from various sources and use it to meet
customer needs.  These agents run on a computational engine called
the "Information Agency" which provides all of the client and server
functions shared among agents and across products.

<p>
 In addition to the Java based reference implementation of the
 information agency, the framework includes  example agents, substantial documentation, style guidelines,
 templates and tools for developing agents.
By adopting a common framework, developers ensure the reusability,
interoperability, and maintainability of their efforts.  This reduces
development time and cuts life-cycle costs.  Additionally the PIA
framework enables customizations to meet particular customer needs
which would be difficult or impossible to provide using alternative approaches.
