<div align='center'>Open Source Goals</div>

<ol>
<li>Enhance Ricoh's ability to build information
applications
<ul> 
<li>engage open source developers to improve core technology
<li>increase speed of development, and lower cost of maintenance
<li>help establish an open standard for building information applications
</ul>
<li> Enable 3rd party support of Ricoh products and position Ricoh as a preferred supplier for solution providers
<ul>
 <li>Catalyze community of developers creating information application
solutions for the workgroup

</ul>
</ul>
</slide>



<hr>
<slide><h2> Closed source vs Open Source </h2>
<table>
<tr><th> Closed <th> Open
<tr> <td>code kept tightly guarded secret
 <td> source distributed on Web sites
<tr> <td>Closed developer community
     <td>Every user is a (potential) developer
<tr> <td> Infrequent releases and bug fixes
     <td> New releases daily, immediate bug fixes
<tr> <td> Single provider
     <td>Distributed expertise
</table>
</slide>

<hr>
<slide><h2> Open Source becoming popular </h2>
<ul>
<li> Linux
 <ul>
 <li> 30M+ Users (gaining market share)
 <li>"Best Networking OS &amp; Best Technical Support" (Infoworld)
 <li> Gaining support RedHat, Compaq, Dell, Oracle, ...
</ul>
<li> Apache
 <ul> 
 <li>Largest market share Web server
 <li>being sold by IBM
 </ul>
<li> Netscape's Mozilla
</ul>
</slide>


<hr>
<slide><h2> Open Source creates better software </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Peer review
  <li> parallel testing
  <ul>
   <li> <i>"all bugs are shallow"</i>
  </ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>
<slide><h2> Open Source reduces development costs </h2>
<ul>
  <li> faster development
  <li>enables customization
  <li>lower support and development costs
</ul>
</slide>


<hr>
<slide><h2> Open Source platform </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Reduces power of software vendors
<ul> 
<li>creates <i>even playing field</i>
</ul>
  <li> Create de facto standard
<ul> 
<li>enables customization
</ul>
  <li>lower support and development costs
<ul>
 <li> guarantees long term survival of technology
<ul>
</ul>
</slide>



<hr>
<slide><h2> Want to Attract Solution providers </h2>
Most Information applications will require customization.
<ul>
  <li> VAR's/Integrators/Consultants provide solutions to the workgroup
  <ul>
  <li> They have close relationship with customers
  <li> They need low-cost, customizable development platform <br>
... to profitably develop solutions
  </ul>
</ul>

</slide>


<hr>
<slide><h2> First we need Initial Developer Community </h2>
VAR's unlikely to be interested until technology is relatively mature.
<ul>
  <li> Initial open source developers use for:
  <ul>
   <li> Information applications for their workgroups 
   <li> personal productivity
  </ul>
  <li> Help improve technology
</ul>

<hr>
<slide><h2> Ricoh's role</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide technical leadership for initial developers
<ul>
<li> oversee (moderate) technology development 
<li>communications infrastructure (web site, mailing list, etc.)
<li>code repository
</ul>
<li>Support solution developers
<ul>
<li> Champion of "open standards" for customer's benefit
<li> Supply horizontal appliances
<li> Supply 3rd parties with customizable platforms
</ul>
</ul>
</slide>




<hr>
<slide><h2>Summary of Open Source effort </h2>
Open Standards for Information application development are critical to Ricoh's
ability to compete in the marketplace for next generation office machines.
<ul>
  <li> Open Source developer community assures long-term viability of
       technology 
  <li> Customization by 3rd party solution providers required to provide
       effective information applications
  <li> Open Source is best way of reaching these developers<br>
       and improving the technology 
 
</ul>
