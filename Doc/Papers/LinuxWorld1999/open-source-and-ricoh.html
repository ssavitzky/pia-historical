<h1>Open Source and Ricoh</h1>

<hr>
<slide><h2>Open Source Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Enhance Ricoh's ability to build information
applications
<ul> 
<li>engage open source developers to improve core technology
<li>increase speed of development, and lower cost of maintenance
<li>help establish an open standard for building information applications
</ul>
<li> Enable 3rd party support of Ricoh products and position Ricoh as a preferred supplier for solution providers
<ul>
 <li>Catalyze community of developers creating information application
solutions for the workgroup

</ul>
</ul>
</slide>



<hr>
<slide><h2> Closed source vs Open Source </h2>
<table>
<tr><th> Closed <th> Open
<tr> <td> code kept tightly guarded secret
     <td> source distributed on Web sites
<tr> <td> closed developer community
     <td> every user is a (potential) developer
<tr> <td> infrequent releases and bug fixes
     <td> new releases daily, immediate bug fixes
<tr> <td> single provider
     <td> distributed expertise
<tr> <td> controlled by the vendor
     <td> easily customized
</table>
</slide>

<hr>
<slide><h2> Open Source becoming popular </h2>
<ul>
<li> Linux (OS)
 <ul>
 <li> 30M+ Users (gaining market share)
 <li>"Best Networking OS &amp; Best Technical Support" (Infoworld)
 <li> Gaining support RedHat, Compaq, Dell, Oracle, ...
</ul>
<li> Apache (web server)
 <ul> 
 <li>Largest market share Web server
 <li>being sold by IBM
 </ul>
<li> Netscape's Mozilla (web browser)
</ul>
</slide>


<hr>
<slide><h2> Open Source creates better software </h2>
<ul>
  <li> peer review = <em>massive</em> QA
  <li> parallel testing
       <ul>
	 <li> <i>"all bugs are shallow"</i>
       </ul>
  <li> fast evolution
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>
<slide><h2> Open Source reduces development costs </h2>
<ul>
  <li> lower support and development costs
       <ul>
	 <li> <em>At the going rate of $100/line, Linux has about $10 billion
	      invested in its development.</em>
       </ul>
  <li> faster development
  <li> enables customization
</ul>
</slide>


<hr>
<slide><h2> Open Source platform </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Reduces power of software vendors
  <li> creates <i>even playing field</i>
       <ul>
	 <li> Create de facto standard
	 <li>enables customization
       </ul> 
       
  <li>lower support and development costs
  <li> guarantees long term survival of technology
</ul>
</slide>



<hr>
<slide><h2> Want to Attract Solution providers </h2>
Most Information applications will require customization.
<ul>
  <li> VAR's/Integrators/Consultants provide solutions to the workgroup
  <ul>
  <li> They have close relationship with customers
  <li> They need low-cost, customizable development platform <br>
... to profitably develop solutions
  </ul>
</ul>

</slide>


<hr>
<slide><h2> First we need Initial Developer Community </h2>
VAR's unlikely to be interested until technology is relatively mature.
<ul>
  <li> Initial open source developers use for:
  <ul>
   <li> Information applications for their workgroups 
   <li> personal productivity
  </ul>
  <li> Help improve technology
</ul>

<hr>
<slide><h2> Ricoh's role</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide technical leadership for initial developers
<ul>
<li> oversee (moderate) technology development 
<li>communications infrastructure (web site, mailing list, etc.)
<li>code repository
</ul>
<li>Support solution developers
<ul>
<li> Champion of "open standards" for customer's benefit
<li> Supply horizontal appliances
<li> Supply 3rd parties with customizable platforms
</ul>
</ul>
</slide>




<hr>
<slide><h2>Summary of Open Source effort </h2>
Open Standards for Information application development are critical to Ricoh's
ability to compete in the marketplace for next generation office machines.
<ul>
  <li> Open Source developer community assures long-term viability of
       technology 
  <li> Customization by 3rd party solution providers required to provide
       effective information applications
  <li> Open Source is best way of reaching these developers<br>
       and improving the technology 
 
</ul>
