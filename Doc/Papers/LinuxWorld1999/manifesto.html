<slide><h2>A brief history of documents: 1</h2>
<b>Back in the Precambrian</b>
<ul>
  <li> Documents were pieces of paper
  <li> Computing was done on pieces of paper
</ul>

<slide><h2>A brief history of documents: 2</h2>
<b>Back in the Jurassic Age</b>
<ul>
  <li> Computers were room-sized
  <li> Programs were decks of punched cards<br>
       described by a complex flowchart
  <li> Data were decks of punched cards<br>
       but at least they didn't break when you sorted them!
</ul>
=== dinosaurs ===
</slide>

<slide><h2>A brief history of documents: 3</h2>
<b>Back in the Paleolithic</b>
<ul>
  <li> Structured Programming was invented
  <li> Programs were reels of magtape<br>
       with a simple outline structure
  <li> Data were reels of magtape, too.
</ul>
=== cave men ===
</slide>

<slide><h2>A brief history of documents: 4</h2>
<b>In the Neolithic</b>
<ul>
  <li> We started growing Apples
  <li> WYSIWYG editors were sold on floppy disks<br>
       Visicalc becomes the first Killer App
  <li> Documents were files on floppies.<br>
       Postscript and PDF made them look just like paper
</ul>
=== something agricultural ===
</slide>

<slide><h2>A brief history of documents: 5</h2>
<b>In the Dark Ages</b>
<ul>
  <li> Object-Oriented Programming was invented
  <li> Programs were collections of objects<br>
       described by a complex class diagram

       and CGI scripts (little, associated with docs)
</ul>
