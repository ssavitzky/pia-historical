<slide><h2>A brief history of documents: 1</h2>
<b>Back in the Precambrian</b>
<ul>
  <li> Documents were pieces of paper
  <li> Computing was done on pieces of paper
</ul>
=== pictographs? ===
</slide>

<slide><h2>A brief history of documents: 2</h2>
<b>Back in the Jurassic Age</b>
<ul>
  <li> Computers were room-sized
  <li> Programs were decks of punched cards<br>
       described by a complex flowchart
  <li> Data were decks of punched cards<br>
       but at least they didn't break when you sorted them!
</ul>
=== dinosaurs ===
</slide>

<slide><h2>A brief history of documents: 3</h2>
<b>Back in the Paleolithic</b>
<ul>
  <li> Structured Programming was invented
  <li> Programs were reels of magtape<br>
       with a simple outline structure
  <li> Data were reels of magtape, too.
</ul>
=== cave men ===
</slide>

<slide><h2>A brief history of documents: 4</h2>
<b>In the Neolithic</b>
<ul>
  <li> We started growing Apples
  <li> Programs were sold on floppy disks
  <li> Documents were text files on floppies.
</ul>
=== something agricultural ===
</slide>

<slide><h2>A brief history of documents: 5</h2>
<b>In the Dark Ages</b>
<ul>
  <li> Object-Oriented Programming was invented
  <li> Programs were collections of objects<br>
       described by a complex class diagram
  <li> Documents became data for classes
</ul>
=== witches burning at the stake? ===
</slide>

<slide><h2>A brief history of documents: 6</h2>
<b>In the Renaissance</b>
<ul>
  <li> The Web was discovered
  <li> Documents were HTML<br>
       with a simple outline structure
  <li> Programs were browsers, servers, and CGI scripts
</ul>
=== old map with web of rhumb lines ===
</slide>

<slide><h2>A brief history of documents: 7</h2>
<b>Now here we are at the Revolution</b>
<ul>
  <li> The Web is <em>everywhere</em>
  <li> Documents are in HTML and XML
  <li> And as for programs...
</ul>
