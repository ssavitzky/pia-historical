<h1>About this document</h1>
This document is one of the series of technical reports describing the PIA
framework.  These technical reports normally correspond to a major release
of the Information Agency and are generated from the online
documentation.
The most up-to-date version of this information can always be found
in the  <a href=../Doc>Doc</a> directory of the PIA framework electronic
distribution.
<p>
The series includes "Introduction to the PIA Framework" which provides an
overview and motivation for this work, "Using the
Information Agency" which shows how to install and use the main component of
the framework, and "Developing Agents using the PIA Framework" for those who
wish to create new services.  A glossary describing these terms can be found
in the appendix of this report.  Related documents on how to use the
framework to build specific applications (Network Office Appliances), the
future of network based computing, and other topics may be found in the
electronic distribution or by contacting the PIA group.
