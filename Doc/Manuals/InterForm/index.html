<h1>PIA InterForm Manual</h1>

<blockquote><em>
  This document is a user's manual for the Personal Information Agency's
  InterForm (Interactive/Interpreted Form) system.
  Eventually it will be an active document, written on the assumption that it
  is being viewed through a PIA.

<h2>Introduction:  What's an InterForm?</h2>

An InterForm is a HTML document that contains some tags that a PIA can
``interpret.''  You can think of an InterForm as an HTML form that doesn't
need a corresponding CGI script to interpret it.  You can also think of it as
an ``active'' document that is run through a special-purpose formatter.<p>

Because the extra tags follow strict SGML syntax conventions, InterForms can
be edited with any text editor, or any HTML editor that lets you use new or
non-standard tags.<p>

We hope that authors will find InterForms to be as easy to use as
word-processor macros or text-formatting style sheets.  Programmers will find
that, in spite of their unfamiliar syntax, InterForms have all the power of
any modern object-based language.<p>
