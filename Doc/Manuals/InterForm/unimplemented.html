<h1>Unimplemented Tagsets</h1>

The following tagsets are not implemented in the current release.

<h3>HTML</h3>

The <b>HTML</b> tagset consists of exactly those tags and entities required
to parse HTML.  No processing is done.  This tagset is usually augmented with
tags that perform specific processing tasks such as extracting links,
submitting or updating forms, or formatting.  Specifically,

<h4>Extraction</h4>

These tagsets are used for extracting specific types of data from a file.
They are usually used with the &lt;file parse tagset=<em>whatever</em>&gt;
actor.

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Extract-HREF</b>
  <dd> extract all <code>href=</code> attributes, returning a list of
       URL's pointing at pages linked to. 
  <dt> <b>Extract-SRC</b>
  <dd> extract all <code>src=</code> attributes, returning a list of
       URL's pointing at images.
  <dt> <b>Extract-Text</b>
  <dd> extract all the text (content), returning a single string.
  <dt> <b>Extract-Links</b>
  <dd> Returns a list of URL/text pairs.
</dl>

<h3>Safe</h3>

The <b>Safe</b> tagset consists of the subset of the <b>Standard</b> tagset
that affects only the file being processed.  It is, consequently, safe to use
the <b>Safe</b> tagset on InterForm files owned by some other user, received
in e-mail, or retrieved from elsewhere in the Web.  The DOFS agent uses the
<b>Safe</b> tagset to process <code>index.if</code> files.<p>

<h3>Secure</h3>

The <b>Secure</b> tagset consists of the subset of the <b>Standard</b> tagset
that cannot convey information outside the PIA's host computer; it does not
contain any tags that invoke commands or make HTTP requests.<p>
