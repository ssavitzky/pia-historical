<h1>PIA Installation Manual</h1>

<blockquote><em>
  This manual describes how to install a Personal Information Agency.
</em></blockquote>

<h2>Obtaining the Files</h2>

<blockquote><em>
  Of course, at the moment anyone reading this is at CRC, and the files are
  already installed in <a href="file:/pia1/pia/"><code>/pia1/pia/</code></a>.
</em></blockquote>

<dl>
  <dt> From Inside Ricoh:
  <dd> Telnet or dial in to CRC, and FTP the compressed sources from
       <a href="file:/pia1/pia/pia.tar.gz"
       ><code>/pia1/pia/pia.tar.gz</code></a>.
  <dt> From Outside Ricoh: 
  <dd> <em>(After the product is released, you will be able to)</em> Obtain a
       copy of the public files from
       <a href="ftp://pia.ricoh.com/pub/pia"
       ><code>ftp://pia.ricoh.com/pub/pia</code></a>, or browse to the
       public Agency at 
       <a href="http://pia.ricoh.com/"><code>http://pia.ricoh.com/</code></a>.
</dl>

<h3>Also Needed</h3>

You will need PERL version 5.002 or newer, and recent versions of
the <code>libwww-perl-5</code> and <code>Net-FTP</code> module libraries.
These can be obtained from any CPAN mirror.<p>

You also need an operating system that supports sockets and long filenames, at
least until we get a Windows 3.1 version working.  We recommend Linux.<p>

Unpacking the files requires <code>tar</code> and <code>gunzip</code> (or GNU
<code>tar</code>).<p>


<h2>Installing the Files</h2>

<h3>At Your Site</h3>

The files are supplied in the form of a <code>gzip</code>'ed <code>tar</code>
file.  Set your working directory to wherever you want the parent directory to
be, and do

<listing>
  gunzip pia.tar.gz
  tar xf pia.tar
</listing>

<h3>In Your Home Directory</h3>

If you are planning to do <em>work</em> on the Agency, you should check out a
working copy into your home directory using CVS.  Assuming that the CVS
repository is in the usual place, <a
href="file:/pia1/CvsRoot/"><code>/pia1/CvsRoot/</code></a>, use the following 
sequence of commands:

<listing>
    cd ~
    setenv CVSROOT /pia1/CvsRoot
    cvs checkout pia
</listing>

(If you're using <code>bash</code>, use
<listing>
export CVSROOT=/pia1/CvsRoot
</listing>
instead of the <code>setenv</code>).
<p>

You now have a working copy of the PIA.  If all you wanted was the source
code, you can check out <code>pia/src</code> instead of <code>pia</code>.
<p>


<h2>Setup</h2>

You will need a subdirectory of your home directory called
"<code>.pia</code>".  Outside of CRC, you should also have an environment
variable <code>PIA_DIR</code> which contains a path to the top of the PIA
directory tree, unless it's in <code>/usr/local</code> or
<code>/usr/local/src</code>.  The executable,
<code>.../pia/src/Agencies/perl_small/pia.pl</code>, assumes that PERL is in
/usr/local/bin, so you may have to either edit <code>pia.pl</code>or make a
symbolic link.  The PIA will look in your home directory, <code>/pia1</code>,
<code>/usr/local/</code>, and <code>/usr/local/src</code> for a directory
called <code>pia</code>.  <p>

You will probably find it convenient to make a symbolic link 
called <code>pia</code> in <em>/usr/local/bin</em> or wherever you keep your
personal binaries.  Assuming <code>PIA_DIR</code> is /usr/local/src/pia, you
can do this with:<p> 

<pre>
  ln -s /usr/local/src/pia/bin/pia /usr/local/bin/
</pre>

<blockquote><em>
  === we <strong>have</strong> to do something about that!
</em></blockquote>

That's it.  Now see <a href="../User/">the User's Manual</a> to get
started.<p> 

<hr>
<h2>Peripheral Agencies</h2>

If an Agency is started by the special user <code>pia</code>, it configures
itself as a ``Peripheral Interface Agency,'' on the assumption that it's being
used to control some peripheral device such as a printer, and also that it
might be being shared among more than one ``real'' user.<p>

Naturally, when Ricoh WebWorts and PIA-based appliances become available, they
will come already configured, with an <code>agency</code> agent customized for
system administration.  Until that glorious time, however, you may find
yourself called upon to configure one.<p>
