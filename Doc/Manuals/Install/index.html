========================================================================

I. Obtaining the Files

   A. From Inside Ricoh

	Connect to CRC via the Internet or direct dialin, and FTP the
	compressed sources from /pia1/pia.  There are two versions of
	the release:

	1)pia_bin.tgz, binary only
	2)pia_src.tgz, binary and source
	
   B. From Outside Ricoh

	If and when the PIA is released to the public, it will be
	obtainable from pia.ricoh.com.  The files mentioned above will
	be accessible via FTP in <pia.ricoh.com:/pub/pia>, or HTTP
	via the public Agency at <http://pia.ricoh.com/>.

   C. From CD-ROM
	If you acquire a PIA CD-ROM, it contains the entire, uncompresed PIA
	directory.  You can run the agency directly from the CD.

   D. Also Needed 

	You will need a Java 1.1 runtime environment.  JDK(TM) 1.1.3 (Sun's
	Java Development Kit) and JRE 1.1.4 (Sun's Java Runtime Environment
	for Windows) are included with the CDROM (within RICOH only) or can
	be obtained from http://www.javasoft.com/.  Other Java virtual
	machines should work but have not been tested. All required code
	outside the JDK is provided with the release.   

	You also need an operating system that supports sockets and long
	filenames.  We have tested the PIA on Linux (Red Hat 4.2) on the
	Intel architecture, Solaris on SPARC, and Windows95.

	Unpacking the files requires tar and gunzip (or GNU tar).

	Some optional utilities and Agents are written in PERL, and require
	PERL version 5.003 or higher.  PERL can be obtained from the
	CPAN archives at http://www.perl.com/



========================================================================
II. Installing the Files  (Choose 1 of the options below)

    A. At Your Site

	The files are supplied in the form of a gzip'ed tar file. Set
	your working directory to wherever you want the parent directory
	to be, for example /usr/local/src, and unpack the files:

	  cd /usr/local/src
	  gunzip pia.tar.gz
	  tar xf pia.tar

	This will create a directory pia/ under the working directory.

    B. In Your Home Directory

	  cd ~
	  gunzip pia.tar.gz
	  tar xf pia.tar

	This will create a directory pia/ under your home directory.

    C. From CD-ROM

	  You can run the PIA from the PIA CD.

    D. Under Source Control (CRC only)

	If you are planning to do work on the Agency, you should check
	out a working copy into your home directory using CVS. Assuming
	that the CVS repository is in the usual place, /pia1/CvsRoot/,
	use the following sequence of commands:

	  cd ~
	  cvs -d /pia1/CvsRoot checkout pia


========================================================================
III. Setup

    A. Environment Variables
	The PIA allows you to indicate the location of the installed PIA
	directory and the directory for storing Agent data and customization
	files.  These variables and their defaults are:

	PIA_DIR=/usr/local/src
	USR_DIR=~/.pia

        (The windows batch file bin/pia.bat tries to assign reasonable
        defaults to these variables.)

	Also, if you are proxying through another server (e.g. a gateway),
	please indicate the server like below:

	HTTP_PROXY=http://int-gw.crc.ricoh.com:80/

    B. The default settings of the PIA are contained in 

	  PIA_DIR/Config/pia.props

	When the PIA starts, it will look for the pia.props under
	USR_DIR/Config/pia.props and then in PIA_DIR/Config/pia.props.
	You can customize the properties by copying PIA_DIR/Config/pia.props
	to USR_DIR/Config/pia.props and modifying it using a text
	editor.

	You may also find it convenient to put the directory "pia/bin"
	into your shell's search path.  (Along with setting PIA_DIR.) 


========================================================================
IV. Running the PIA

    A. Starting the program

	a. Under Unix

		Run the pia with the command:

		  pia/bin/pia

		This is a one-line shell script that runs "pia_wrapper".  A
		complete list of command-line options can be found by running

		  pia/bin/pia -?

		The first time the PIA is run, it will create a directory under
		your home directory:

		  ~/.pia/

		This is used for storing Agent data and customization files.

	b. Under Windows95

                Double-click on PIA_DIR/bin/piajre.bat
                or
		Run the pia with the command:
			
		   pia/bin/piajre.bat
		
		To use the JDK (e.g. if you modify classes)
			
		   pia/bin/pia.bat	

    B. Using the PIA

	The PIA is essentially a Web server.  Assuming you are running
	a Web browser on the same host as the PIA, simply browse to

	  http://localhost:8888/PIA/Doc

	You will eventually want to set your browser's proxies to the
	PIA as well.

    B. Other questions or comments can be sent to pia_bugs@crc.ricoh.com


========================================================================
VI. Peripheral Agencies

	If an Agency is started by the special user pia, it configures
	itself as a ``Peripheral Interface Agency,'' on the assumption
	that it's being used to control some peripheral device such as a
	printer, and also that it might be being shared among more than
	one ``real'' user.

	Naturally, when Ricoh WebWorts and PIA-based appliances become
	available, they will come already configured, with an agency
	agent customized for system administration. Until that glorious
	time, however, you may find yourself called upon to configure
	one.

	Each kind of peripheral is controlled by an Agent which has a
	configuration information in a subdirectory of 

	  pia/Config
