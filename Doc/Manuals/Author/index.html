<h1>Agent Author's Manual</h1>

<blockquote><em>
  This document is a manual for people writing Agents in the PIA system.  It
  provides a style guide, organizational techniques, and tips for the
  technical writer.  The extended HTML tags used for writing the InterForm
  documents that make agents actually <em>work</em> are described more
  completely in the <a href="../InterForm/index.html">InterForm Manual</a>.

  <dt> <b>Note:</b>
  <dd> This manual will be easiest to read using a PIA; you can find it at <a
       href="/PIA/Doc/Manuals/Author/index.html"
       >/PIA/Doc/Manuals/Author/index.html</a>.  Using the PIA, you will be
       able to  follow links to actual examples as they come up in the text.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

===<p>


<h2>Anatomy of an Agent</h2>

===<p>


<h2>Agents with Style</h2>

Well, there was Sean Connery as James Bond... Sorry, wrong context.<p>

Actually, PIA agents, and active documents in general, are so new that few
conventions have become established, and there is considerable room for
experimentation.  A few rules of thumb have become clear, however.<p>

<h3>Quick Reference Up Front</h3>

An agent's home page is the easiest part to get to, naturally, and many users
will have browsers with small  screens.  So it makes sense to put the
most-commonly-used functions, and links to the most-commonly-used pages, as
close to the top of an agent's home page as possible.<p>

<h3>Active Documentation</h3>

InterForms make it easy to mix controls or forms with their documentation.
Thus, it is possible not only to <em>describe</em> a function like a <a
href="/agency/installers.if">link to a useful page</a> or a form, but to
provide the thing itself and invite the reader to try it out on the spot.<p>

=== needs examples, obviously ===<p>

Wherever possible, an agent should be essentially self-documenting, including
links to whatever other documents a user may need.  This includes tips on
customization as well as advice on how to set the options.  A
<code>HEADER.html</code> file is particularly useful, since it can provide
documentation that the user will see while browsing the agent's source code
directory <em>before</em> installing it.<p>

<h3>Readable Source</h3>

Of course the output, the user's view, of an InterForm should be easily read,
understood, and used.  But so should the input--the <em>author's</em> view.
After all, this is the file as <em>you</em> will be working with it.  Indent
the content of elements such as lists and control structures.  Leave yourself
short notes in the form of comments, and longer ones in a separate file.  Keep
a <a href="../../Notes/Steve/to-do.html">to-do list</a>.  Document your design
decisions, including things you tried that turned out to be mistakes.<p>

<!-- Good for you!  This is what an HTML comment looks like. -->

Remember, an agent's InterForms will be read not only by their author, but by
any users who want to customize or extend it.  If the agent is complicated,
consider writing an ``implementation details'' document, or even an ``<a
href="../Internals/">internals manual.</a>'' <p>
