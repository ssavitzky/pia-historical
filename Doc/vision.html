<h1> Trends in Information Processing</h1>
The trend in information processing is away from complex, high maintenance,
difficult to use
computers running complex applications towards more simple, single purpose
"appliances."   Web browsers exemplify and accelerate this trend by
providing a simple user interface for viewing virtually any type of
information.
<p>
As hardware gets cheaper, the main value add will come from the
knowledge which enables appliances to perform complex tasks while
presenting a simple  interface to the users.  For example, a scanner
might analyze a document and automatically file it into the correct
categories.  This requires substantial complex processing, but little
or no effort on the part of the user.  Over the long run,
the ability to create and maintain knowledge about business processes
will become the key competitive advantage for office machines.  The PIA framework 
provides a process and platform for developing and deploying this
knowledge.  
  In other words, PIA framework supports the rapid prototyping and
  development of Network Office Appliances.


<!-- 
Note that a simple interface does not imply that the system itself is simple.
In fact, building a system which is simple to use often requires much more
effort and hidden complexity than traditional applications.

Knowledge is the key added value.

Platform for deploying knowledge as customer solutions.

Process for developing knowledge to meet customer needs.

HW getting cheaper, time getting scarcer.

Traditional peripherals, such as
printers and scanners, rely on  properly configured PC's and do not work
as appliances.  Traditional office machines, such as copiers and fax,
manipulate only paper documents and will not work in the electronic document
office.  In the future, the functions of these machines may be served by a new
class of Information Appliances, which can send, retrieve, and manipulate
electronic (and paper) documents.<br>

<h1> Platform</h1>
 The key components of these appliances will be similar across different
 product lines.  These include retrieving, generating, sending, and
 manipulating electronic documents.  We bundle these functions together in an
 "Information Agency", so called because it manages the collection of agents which operate
 on the documents.  This agency, represented by the red pentagons in the image
 above, provides a fundamental building block on which
 information appliances of almost any scale can be built upon.

<br>  <caption> Agents on the web printer can download files from other web
      servers, format those documents for printing (here in two columns),
      return previews of printed pages, download entire web sites to create
      books, provide status information, automatically contact service bureaus
      when needed, .... <br></caption>
  <p>
Oftentimes an appliance,  for example a WebPrinter, sits between a user's
browser and a server providing a location for task specific computation
(embodied by agents) that might integrate several services.   This can
be thought of as a new kind of middleware, intermediate between servers and
clients.  By encapsulating these functions within a single box,
we greatly reduce the burden on users (no software installation, no training,
no incompatibilities to resolve, etc.), improve reliability and performance,
and can provide new value added features.

<p>
<!-- The PIA group is building this enabling technology, and developing a strategy
 for rapidly prototyping and constructing the software components of
 Information Appliances.
-->

<p>
Agents embody this knowledge as either extended markup language (XML)
documents or traditional software programs.  By adopting  a common
framework we can  leveraged this knowledge to gain a competitive
advantage in building office machines.
