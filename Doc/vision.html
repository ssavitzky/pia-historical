<h1> Office Environs</h1>
The trend in document processing is away from complex, difficult to use
computers running bloated applications towards simple, single purpose
"appliances", such as Network Computers (NC). Traditional peripherals, such as
printers and scanners, rely on  properly configured PC's and will not work
with nor as appliances.  Traditional office machines, such as copiers and fax,
manipulate only paper documents and will not work in the electronic document
office.  Instead, the functions of these machines will be served by a new
class of Information Appliances, which can send, retrieve, and manipulate
electronic (and paper) documents.<br>

<h1> Platform</h1>
 The key components of these appliances will be similar across different
 product lines.  These include retrieving, generating, sending, and
 manipulating electronic documents.  We bundle these functions together in an
 "agency", so called because it manages the collection of agents which operate
 on the documents.  This agency, represented by the red pentagons in the image
 above, provides a fundamental building block on which
 information appliances of almost any scale can be built upon.

web documents for printing.</b></center>
<br>  <caption> Agents on the web printer can download files from other web
      servers, format those documents for printing (here in two columns),
      return previews of printed pages, download entire web sites to create
      books, provide status information, automatically contact service bureaus
      when needed, .... <br></caption>
<p>
Notice that the appliance, in this case a WebPrinter, sits between a user's
browser and a server providing a location for task specific computation
(embodied by agents).  By encapsulating these functions within a single box,
we greatly reduce the burden on users (no software installation, no training,
no incompatibilities to resolve, etc.), improve reliability and performance,
and can provide new value added features.

<p>
 The PIA group is building this enabling technology, and developing a strategy
 for rapidly prototyping and constructing the software components of
 Information Appliances.
