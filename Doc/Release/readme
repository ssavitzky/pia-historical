II. Release Note
----------------
This is 1.0 (Alpha) release of the Information Agency.  The
Information Agency is a proxy web server (implemented in Java) that
provides an environment for document processing agents.  This release
includes several demonstration agents and serves as an introduction to
rapid prototyping of Network User Interfaces using PIA technology.

We recommend that interested users start by installing and running
their own Personal Information Agency as described in the next
section.  Once the agency is running, you can view further
documentation through the agency and try customizing the demonstration
agents.

For further information about using the PIA to prototype Network User
Interfaces see and agent concepts, please see the paper entitled
"Building Network Office Appliances using the PIA Framework" which can
be found on this CD in the pia/Doc/Papers/BuildingNOA directory (in
Postscript, Latex, and HTML formats) or contact the PIA group would by
sending mail to pia@crc.ricoh.com.  Our website, http://pia.crc.ricoh.com/
may soon be available on RWAN.


III.A Quick Start -- Running from the CD
---------------------------------------
A Personal Information Agency can be run directly from this CD (if you
are using Windows or another OS which understands the Joliet file
system so that long file names can be used).

	Windows
	   If "autoplay" is enabled, then the agency should start
	   automatically when the CD is inserted.
	   Otherwise, you can start the agency by running
	   pia\bin\pia.bat
	   The directory C:\PIAUSERS will be created to store local
           data.  (To change the location of this directory or other 
 	   options, see the installation manual in pia\Doc\Manuals\INSTALL.)

	Unix 
	    	cd pia
		./bin/pia

Once the agency is running, point your web browser at:
	http://localhost:8888/
("localhost" can be replaced by the name or IP address of your computer.)


III.B Installing onto HD
------------------------
If you cannot run from the CD, install the distribution onto your
local drive.  The binary distribution is included on this CD as:
	piabin.tgz
and contains all the necessary files. (piasrc.tgz distribution
includes the .java source files.)

This is a tar file that has been compressed with gzip.  
	(The Unix command: gunzip -c piabin.tgz | tar -xf - 
 	 should extract all the files.  
 	 The WINZIP utility can be used under windows.)

After unpacking, the PIA can be run using the PIAHOME/bin/pia script.
(This script sets up the CLASSPATH and runs:  java crc.pia.Pia )

See the installation manual for more details (pia/INSTALL).


IV. Supported platforms / Java VM
--------------------------------
The PIA is a java application (NOTE: it is NOT an applet) and requires
a Java Virtual Machine (VM) version 1.1 or greater to run.  
This CD includes a VM for Windows (JDK 1.1.4) and Linux (JDK 1.1.3).

The latest releases and Java Virtual Machines for other platforms can
be found at the Javasoft site:
