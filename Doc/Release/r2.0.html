<h2><A NAME="announce">Release Announcements</A></h2>
<h3>Release 2.0b</h3>
<p>

This is an (internal) version of a major upgrade of the PIA.  It is
hoped that Release 2.0 will be the first public, open-source release of the
PIA. 

<p>

We recommend that interested users start by installing and running their own
Personal Information Agency.  (See the <a href="../Manuals/Install">
Installation manual</a> for instructions.)
Once the agency is running, you can view further documentation and try
customizing the demonstration agents.

<h3><A NAME="newfeatures">New Features</A></h3>
<h4>Document Processing System</h4>

<p>The Document Processing System is a completely new rewrite of the PIA's
extension language for active HTML and XML documents.  The parser can handle
both HTML and XML, and the internal data structures are compliant with the <a
href="http://www.w3c.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>'s
<a href="http://www.w3c.org/DOM/">Document Object Model</a> standard.

<p>Details can be found in the <a href="../Manuals/Api">API Manual</a>, and of
course in the <a href="../../src/java/crc/dps">source code</a>.

<p>

<h4>New Tag Language</h4>

<p>The extension programming language used to write active documents
(InterForms) has been almost completely revised, and considerably simplified.
Details can be found in the  <a href="../Manuals/InterForm">InterForm
Manual.</a>. 

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Note:</b>
  <dd> As of this release, some of the new tags are still unimplemented. 
</dl>
<p>

<h4>Simplified Interfaces</h4>

Many interfaces in the PIA have been simplified. 

<h3><A NAME="information"> Additional Information</A></h3>
