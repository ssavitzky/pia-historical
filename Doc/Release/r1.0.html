<h1>Release Notes for PIA Release 1.0</h1>

<h2>Release Announcements</h2>

<h3>Release 1.0 Alpha</h3>

<p>

The PIA group is pleased to announce the beta release of the Information
Agency.  The Information Agency is a proxy web server (implemented in Java)
that provides an environment for document processing agents.  This release
includes several demonstration agents and serves as an introduction to rapid
prototyping of Network User Interfaces using PIA technology.

<p>

We recommend that interested users start by installing and running their own
Personal Information Agency.  (See the <a href="../Manuals/Install">
Installation manual</a> for instructions.)
Once the agency is running, you can view further documentation and try
customizing the demonstration agents.

<p>
For an extended discussion of using the PIA framework to create Network Office
Appliances, see the paper titled <a href="../Papers/BuildingNOA/"> Building
Network Office Appliances using the PIA Framework</a> (CRC TR-97-??).
Future releases will include many more tools for helping developers create
useful agents.

<p>
The latest information regarding PIA technology can be found on the PIA
group's web site:

All feedback is greatly appreciated.

<p>

Thanks for your support,<br>
The PIA Group (Greg, Steve, Rithy)
