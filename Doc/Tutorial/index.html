<h2><a name="basics"> The Basics</a></h2>
<h3>   <a name="running">Running a Personal Information Agency</a></h3>

<a href="#viewing">(Skip to the next section if you already have an agency
 running.)</a><p>

An <it> Information Agency</it> is a software program written in Java.  To run
it, you need access to a Java "runtime" (e.g. "java" should be located in one
of the directories on your  <code> PATH</code> -- usually either
<code>/usr/local/java/bin</code>, as it is on the Suns at CRC, or
<code>/usr/java/bin</code>, as it is on most Linux systems) and a PIA home
directory (you can either use <code>/pia1/pia</code> or <a
href="../../INSTALL"> install </a> your own).
<p>

To run the pia, execute the command <code>PIA_HOME/bin/pia</code>, where
<code> PIA_HOME</code> is the PIA home directory. Sun users at CRC can simply
type <code>jpia</code> (<code>/usr/local/bin/jpia</code> is a shell wrapper
which executes <code>pia</code> using <code>/pia1/pia</code> as the PIA
directory).
<p>

Once you have an agency running, you should be able to view your agency's home
page at <code>
<a href="http://localhost:8888/">http://<i>YOUR.HOST.NAME.HERE</i>:8888/</a>
</code> using any browser.
<p>
 If you have trouble getting to this point, please contact the <a
 href="../pia_group.html"> PIA group </a>.

<h3>   <a name="viewing">Viewing an agents home page</a></h3>
We call our system an Information Agency because every document (or request
for a document) is processed by one or more agents. Agents are software <b>
objects with an attitude </b>.  Typically, they perform some specific task
<em>on your behalf</em> (which is why they're called <em>agents</em>)
while maintaining state and context information.  (This state maintenance
along with the Agency framework allows agents to be more flexible, and much
easier to generate and maintain than traditional web processes such as CGI
scripts.)
<p>

If you have not already done so, please open another browser window on your
 <a href="http://localhost:8888/"> agency's home page</a>.

<p>
Notice the url for this page:
<pre>
http://localhost:8888/Agency/ROOTindex.if
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^
      1                  2         3     </pre>

It consists of three parts
<ol>
  <li>  <code>http://.../</code> -- the machine name and port number
  <li>   <code> Agency</code> -- the name of the agent handling this request
  <li>  <code>ROOTindex.if</code> --  an InterForm file name
</ol>

<p>
 This url denotes a request to the <tt>Agency</tt> agent (part 2) running on
 your local information agency (part 1).  The <tt>Agency</tt>
 agent is sort of the mother of all agents. It is the agent responsible for
 installing, removing, and listing other agents -- along with some
 miscellaneous things like <a href="/Agency/bugs.if">reporting bugs</a>. 

<p>
The third part,   <code>ROOTindex.if,</code> indicates the InterForm -- an
html file with some special tags -- that the agent processed in order to
generate the page that your browser is display.

<p>
On this page, you should see  a listing of all the agents currently running on
your information agency.  Click on one of the agent links to see the home page
for that agent.  By default, the agency comes configured to start up with the following agents.
<dl>
  <dt> <tt> Agency</tt>
  <dd> main agent-- manages all other agents
  <dt> <tt> History</tt>
  <dd> maintains list of visited web pages --  see below
  <dt> <tt> FBI</tt>
  <dd> adds control menu to pages served by your information agency
  <dt> <tt>CIA</tt>
  <dd> adds control menu to pages proxied through your agency
  <dt> <tt> InterForm</tt>
  <dd> demonstrates features of the InterForm language (the extension of HTML
       in which agents are written)
  <dt> <tt> PIA</tt>
  <dd> serves files located in the PIA_HOME directory
  <dt> <tt>MY</tt>
  <dd>  serves files located in your local PIA_DATA directory (usually ~/.pia)
</dl>

<h3>   <a name="using">Using the history agent</a></h3>
 The History agent is meant to keep track of all web pages that you visit from
 any browser, allowing you to search those url by date or other feature.
To make best use of the History agent, you should set your browsers to use
your local information agency as your proxy (this setting is usually found under the
Network options available under edit/preferences, options/network, or some
similar menu).
<p>
 Once you set your Information Agency as your proxy, browse to a few external
 web pages, then visit the  <a href="/History/home.if"> History agent's home
 page</a>. You should see a link to today's date (e.g. <tt>My/History / 1997 /
 08 / 04</tt>) which will list the pages you visited.

<h3>  <a name="directories">Directory structure</a></h3>
 In addition to the PIA_HOME directory (which contains all the code,
 documentation, agents, etc. released by the PIA group), your information
 agency also uses PIA_DATA (typically ~/.pia) to store agent data and
 customized interforms.  By default, agents will read and write their data
 files into PIA_DATA/AGENT_NAME (where AGENT_NAME is the name of the agent.)
 For their InterForms, agents look first in PIA_DATA/Agents/AGENT_NAME, and
 then in PIA_HOME/Agents/AGENT_NAME making it easy to customize your agents
 simply by putting new InterForm files in
 PIA_DATA/Agents/AGENT_NAME/FILENAME.if


<h2>  <a name="agents">Agents &amp; InterForms</a> </h2>
 Agents are persistent software objects running on the information agency.
 When they receive a request for a document, they look for a file (in
 PIA_xxxx/Agents/AGENT_NAME) which matches that request.  Once the file is
 found, they  interpret that file  and return the result.  To the end user,
 these files provide a <em>form</em>-based <em>interface</em> for interacting
 with the agent, 
 hence they are called InterForms (with <code>.if</code> as the conventional
 extension.) In 
 addition to standard HTML tags, InterForms can include several additional
 tags or entities which the agent understands processes.  So, for example, if
 an InterForm for the History agent includes the text:
 <code>&amp;agentName;</code> (the &amp;xxx; denotes an "entity") the agent
 will substitute it's name for this entity,  so in the browser the user would
 see <code> History</code>.
<p>
For more examples, see the <a href="/InterForm"> InterForm</a> demo agent and
the <a href="../Manuals/InterForm/index.html">InterForm Manual</a>.

<h3>   <a name="InterForms">Customizing an agent</a></h3>
 To add  new function to the History agent, create a file,
 <tt>~/.pia/Agents/History/today.if</tt> (assuming that PIA_HOME=~/.pia) with
 the following contents:<br>

 <code>
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;   <br>
&lt;h2&gt; Web pages visited Today&lt;/h2&gt;   <br>
&lt;read file="&amp;year;/&amp;month;/&amp;day;.html&gt;   <br>
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;   <br>
</code>
<br>
 Save that file (today.if) and then use your browser to view the url  <a
 href="/History/today.if">/History/today.if</a>
 If you have been using your agency as a proxy to view external documents, you
 should get a listing of all places you visited today.

<h3>  <a name="creating"> Creating a new agent -- "HelloWorld"</a></h3>
 To create your own agent, first create a directory,
 <tt>~/.pia/Agents/HelloWorld</tt>.  Now create a home page for your agent, 
 <tt>~/.pia/Agents/HelloWorld/home.if</tt> with something like the following
 content:
<br>

 <code>
&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt;    <br>
&lt;h2&gt;  I am the &amp;agentName; agent &lt;/h2&gt;   <br>
My owner is &amp;piaUSER;.   <br>
&lt;if&gt;&lt;get form name=data&gt;&lt;then&gt;   <br>
 You asked &lt;get form name=data&gt;   <br>
 to which I have no answer yet.   <br>
&lt;/then&gt;&lt;else&gt;   <br>
&lt;form action="&amp;urlPath; method=post&gt;   <br>
&lt;input name="data"&gt;   <br>
&lt;input type="submit" value="AskMe"&gt;   <br>
&lt;/form&gt;   <br>
&lt;/else&gt;   <br>
&lt;/if&gt;   <br>
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;   <br>
</code>

<p>
Now install your agent using the
<a href="/Agency/install_agent.if">/Agency/install_agent.if</a>  InterForm.
(Go to that page, enter <tt>HelloWorld</tt> as the name of your agent and
click on the install button.)
<p>
You should now the able to see and interact with your  <a
href="/HelloWorld/home.if">HelloWorld agent</a>.

<h3>   <a name="advanced">Advanced topics</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt>  <a href="/Agency/START-UP.html"><tt> START-UP.html</tt></a>
  <dd>  On start-up, the agency looks in PIA_xxx/Agents/Agency/START-UP.html
	for any agents that should be installed.  You will probably want to
	copy and modify this file to start your own agents.
  <dt>  Examples
  <dd>  For more examples of agent InterForms, look in the  <a
	href="/PIA/Agents/">existing agent directories </a>.  (NOTE: We still
	need to select the most appropriate examples for learning.)
       
  <dt>  InterForms
  <dd>  See  <a href="/InterForm/demo.if"> InterForm demo page</a> for example
	uses of InterForm tags and the <a href="/PIA/Doc/Manuals/InterForm/">InterForm manual</a> for
	detailed Interform usage and functions.  In particular, note that
	entity variables can be several levels deep.  For example,
	<tt>&amp;AGENT.employees.1;</tt> might return the first item in a list
	of employees associated with this agent. 
  <dt>  Initialization
  <dd> An agents <tt> initialize.if</tt> InterForm is loaded and interpreted
       when an agent starts up (if it exists)
  <dt>  Inheritance
  <dd>  Standard forms (like options.if) can be inherited from the Agents
	directory (the agent will look in PIA_xxx/Agents if a form is not
	found in PIA_xxx/Agents/AGENT_NAME) 
  <dt>  Processing documents not specifically requested
  <dd>  The agency allows an agent to process documents moving through the
	agency even if they are not specifically directed at that agent.  For
	example, the History and CIA agents process all proxied documents.
	Each agent registers a criteria for the documents it is interested
	in.  Whenever the agency sees a document (requests for documents are
	considered documents in their own right), the agency gives the
	matching agent(s) a chance to process the document before sending it
	on to its destination.
