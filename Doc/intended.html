<h1>Intended Audience</h1>

This version of the PIA, 0.9, is an internal alpha release and is intended to
be used by application programmers.  <p>

Even though we have done our best to offer you a pleasant ``out of the box''
experience, please remember that this release is experimental.  We are faced
with a challenge to bring this technology to product quality quickly.
Therefore, your feedback is greatly appreciated.<p>

Please email any comments to

<p>
Thank you,<br>
--the PIA group.
