<h1>The PIA group</h1>
The PIA group was officially formed in January 1997 after
 many months of contemplating key  technologies for future office
 environments.
 <p>
 PIA stands for (among other things) <i>Platforms for Information
 Appliances</i>.    We believe that the office machines of the future will be
 simple, task based devices (<i>appliances</i>) for manipulating  paper and
 electronic documents (<i>information</i>).
 <br><b>Our charter:</b> Design and
 build the key technologies which makes Information Appliances possible and
 powerful. 
 <br><b> Our customers:</b> We work with product groups to implement our
 framework on their devices.
 <br><b> Our technology:</b>  Consists of three pieces,
<ol>
  <li> a<i> Core</i> for
 sending and receiving electronic documents and managing the electronic
 "agents" which process those document,
  <li>  an html based language for instructing  agents, and
  <li> an agent development kit facilitating  the creation of domain specific
  agents
</ol>
