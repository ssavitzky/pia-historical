<h1>The PIA group</h1>
The PIA group was officially formed in January 1997 after
 months of contemplating key  technologies for future office
 environments.
 <p>
 PIA stands for (among other things) <i>Platforms for Information
 Appliances</i>.    We believe that office machines of the future will be
 simple, task based devices (<i>Appliances</i>) for manipulating  paper and
 electronic documents (<i>information</i>).

 <p><b>Our charter:</b>  Develop a framework or <i>platform</i> for building Information Appliances. 
 <p><b> Our customers:</b> Product groups  can use our framework in two ways:
<ol>
  <li>  for rapid prototyping of product concepts (See our <a
	href="demos.html">Demos</a> for examples)
  <li>  as a software design and specification
</ol>
 
 <p><b> Our technology:</b>  Consists of three pieces,
<ol>  <li> a core <i> Agency</i> for
 sending and receiving electronic documents and managing the electronic
 "agents" which process those document,
  <li>  an html based language for instructing  agents, and
  <li> an agent development kit facilitating  the creation of domain specific
  agents
</ol>

For current information, announcements, and software releases see our  <a
