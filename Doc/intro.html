<h1>Introduction to PIA's</h1>

 A PIA is a kind of web server that acts as sort of an electronic secretary;
 making requests, processing documents, and handling inquiries on behalf of an
 "owner".  Actually, it may be more accurate to describe the PIA itself as an
 electronic office where the electronic "secretaries", known as agents, do
 their work.

<p>
 A Personal Information Agency acts on behalf of the user who owns the
 agency.  Typically the user will set their web browsers to use their agency
 as the proxy setting, so that all the users requests for web documents will
 be forwarded through the agency.  This allows the agents to, for example,
 maintain a searchable list of all documents ever visited by that user,
 regardless of what browser (netscape, explorer) or which computers (mac, pc,
 unix) the person uses.

<p>
A Peripheral Information Agency acts on behalf of a device, such as a printer,
providing access to the functions of that device from any web browser, and
providing new features such as the ability to downloaded, format, and print
web pages directly.
(Ideally, peripheral information agencies will turn complicated, difficult to
use computer peripherals into easy to use Information Appliances.  The
official PIA acronym is "Platform for Information Appliances".)
Personal and Peripheral Information Agencies share the
same basic infrastructure (the "agency"), they differ only in which agents are
installed and running.



<h1> Using a PIA </h1>

The full potential of the PIA approach will only be
realized as users and developers build useful, task oriented agents.  The PIA
group has focused on building a solid agency that enables rapid development
and customization of agents.  We have provided a number of example agents to
demonstrate some possibilities.  If you are running your own Personal
Information Agency please work through the <a
href=Tutorial/index.html>tutorial</a> to learn how to modify and create your
own agents.

<h2>More details on Agencies</h2>
<h3>What Is an Agency?</h3>

An <dfn>Agency</dfn> (usually abbreviated <dfn>PIA</dfn> for reasons that will
become clear in the next paragraph) is a program that manages a collection of
software <dfn>agents</dfn>, which operate on and communicate by means of
messages called ``<dfn>transactions</dfn>''.  Transactions are of two types:
<dfn>requests</dfn> and <dfn>responses</dfn>.  The difference is that a
response is generated by some agent or external server in reply to some
request, while a request is ``unsolicited.''<p>

An Agency operates on behalf of either an individual user (a Personal
Information Agency), a group of users (a Public Interaction Agency), or even a
piece of hardware (a Peripheral Interface Agency).  PIA can also stand for
``Platform for Intelligent Agents'' or ``Platform for Information
Appliances.''<p> 

Outside the Agency, requests and responses are transmitted using HTTP, a
standard Internet protocol which is completely operating-system and
programming-language independent.  Clients and servers for HTTP are in
widespread, almost universal, use.  An Agency, then, provides a way of
examining, modifying, and re-routing transactions among the various clients
and servers.  It can, itself, operate as a client, server, cache, and proxy
server at various times.  As such, it provides a new platform for
document-oriented computing.<p> 

The Agency acts as a platform for computing using a collection of ``agents,''
each of which is seen as a ``sub-directory'' of the Agency's URL.  Each agent,
in turn, is simply a collection of documents.  Some of these documents, called
<dfn>InterForms</dfn> (for ``interactive forms'' or ``interface forms'', are
<em>active</em> documents.<p>

<h2>What Does it Do?</h2>


<h2>Details</h2>

<h3>How Does it Work?</h3>

Each transaction has a set of named <dfn>features</dfn> with corresponding
values (mostly boolean) which are computed when needed.  Each agent has a set
of <dfn>criteria</dfn> that are matched against a transaction's features;
agents that match a transaction are allowed to ``act on'' it, i.e. to perform
whatever operation the agent is designed to do.<p>

A transaction also has a queue of objects (mainly agents and transactions)
called ``<dfn>satisfiers</dfn>''.  After every agent has operated on a
transaction, the Agency will attempt to ``satisfy'' the transaction by
invoking the <code>handle</code> method of each object in the queue.  If none
of them return <code>true</code>, the Agency will perform a default action,
either generating an error transaction for an unsatisfied request or
forwarding a response to its destination.<p>

Except for a small number of built-in agents, everything that an agent does is
done by ``running'' an InterForm document (for example,
<code>act_on.if</code>,  <code>handle.if</code>, or <code>home.if</code>).  <p>
