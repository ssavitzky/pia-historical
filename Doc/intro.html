<h1>Introduction to PIA's</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>What Is an Agency?</h3>

An <dfn>Agency</dfn> (usually abbreviated <dfn>PIA</dfn> for reasons that will
become clear in the next paragraph) is a program that manages a collection of
software <dfn>agents</dfn>, which operate on and communicate by means of
messages called ``<dfn>transactions</dfn>''.  Transactions are of two types:
<dfn>requests</dfn> and <dfn>responses</dfn>.  The difference is that a
response is generated by some agent or external server in reply to some
request, while a request is ``unsolicited.''<p>

An Agency operates on behalf of either an individual user (a Personal
Information Agency), a group of users (a Public Interaction Agency), or even a
piece of hardware (a Peripheral Interface Agency).  <p>

Outside the Agency, requests and responses are transmitted using HTTP, a
standard Internet protocol which is completely operating-system and
programming-language independent.  Clients and servers for HTTP are in
widespread, almost universal, use.  An Agency, then, provides a way of
examining, modifying, and re-routing transactions among the various clients
and servers.  It can, itself, operate as a client, server, cache, and proxy
server at various times.  As such, it provides a new platform for
computing.<p> 


<h3>How Does it Work?</h3>

Each transaction has a set of named <dfn>features</dfn> with corresponding
values (mostly boolean) which are computed when needed.  Each agent has a set
of <dfn>criteria</dfn> that are matched against a transaction's features;
agents that match a transaction are allowed to ``act on'' it, i.e. to perform
whatever operation the agent is designed to do.<p>

A transaction also has a queue of objects (mainly agents and transactions)
called ``<dfn>satisfiers</dfn>''.  After every agent has operated on a
transaction, the Agency will attempt to ``satisfy'' the transaction by
invoking the <code>handle</code> method of each object in the queue.  If none
of them return <code>true</code>, the Agency will perform a default action,
either generating an error transaction for an unsatisfied request or
forwarding a response to its destination.<p>
