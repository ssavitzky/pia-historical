<h1>.../pia/Doc</h1>

This directory contains documentation generated by members of the PIA Project
at CRC.<p>

Any document that is not a self-contained HTML file should have its own
subdirectory; that way it can have whatever structure it needs and still be
addressable as a single, simple URL.<p>
