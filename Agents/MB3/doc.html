<h1> Documentation for MB3</h1>

<blockquote>
  This agent is used for scheduling and controlling 
the Ricoh MB-3 Media Board.  See <a href=/PIA/Config/MB3/header.html>
configuration files </a> for instructions on how to download and run a local
version.

<h3> Notes on the MB3 device</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> Touchscreen
  <dd>  The touch screen currently works.  Tapping emulates a mouse click
	(accompanied by a beep).
  <dt>  Mouse
  <dd>  A normal mouse attached to the computer (open the top
	drawer).
  <dt> Screen
  <dd>  The screen operates at 640x480 resolution.
  <dt> DVD
  <dd>  The DVD drive will read digital video disks or normal CD's.
	<strong>It will NOT read CD-R disks</strong> (CD-RW disks are OK.)

<h3>Notes on the MB3 agent / PIA </h3>
<dl>
  <dt> Proxy
  <dd> Browsers on the MB3 device should have the PIA
       <code>&piaHOST;:&piaPORT; </code> set as their proxy.  This allows the
       <a href=/History> history agent </a> to keep track of all Web pages
       visited during a presentation, and the <a href=/CIA> CIA agent </a> to
       add navigation bars to the visited pages.
  <dt> Events
  <dd>   Events are stored in a file corresponding to the day of the event.
	 These files are located in <code>&usrDIR;/&agentName;/YYYY/MM/DD
	 </code> (YYYY=year, MM=month, DD=day).
  <dt>  Annotations
  <dd>  The plan is to have screen annotations (drawings) to be automatically
	saved to to a directory.  These annotations would then be converted to
	gif or jpg files and viewable as part of the presentation.
