<h3> Notes on the MB3</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> Touchscreen
  <dd>  The touch screen currently works.  Tapping emulates a mouse click
	(accompanied by a beep).
  <dt>  Mouse
  <dd>  There is a normal mouse attached to the computer (open the top
	drawer).  A <b> <a href="http://www.gyropoint.com/"> Gyropoint</a></b>
	mouse is  available and can be hooked up.  To use that mouse, plug it
	in where the current mouse is plugged in, then reboot, turn on the
	transmitter (on belt clip) the green light should be on.  Press the
	but on the bottom of the unit (the "activate" button) once to activate the mouse (should hear
	the gyros spin up). Now simply  tilt your hand left/right or up/down
	to move the mouse.  The buttons on top work like normal mouse
	buttons.  The mouse has a second mode which requires you to hold down
	the activate to register movement -- to get out of that mode, simply
	click the activate button.   Please turn off the transmitter when
	done.
  <dt> Screen
  <dd>  The screen operates at 640x480 resolution.
  <dt> DVD
  <dd>  The DVD drive will read digital video disks or normal CD's.
	<strong>It will NOT read CD-R disks</strong> (CD-RW disks are OK.)
