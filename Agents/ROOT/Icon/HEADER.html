<h1>Icons for Agents</h1>

This directory contains icons that are shared by many agents.  Icons that are
agent-specific should go into the Agent's home directory.  Putting icons under
Agency allows them to be overridden by the user.  It also ensures that they
will be available; the Agency agent is always running.<p>
