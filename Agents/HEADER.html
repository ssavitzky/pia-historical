<h1>.../pia/Agents</h1>

This directory contains a directory for each agent or agent type; each agent
or type is contained in a subdirectory.  This allows each agent to consist of
multiple CGI scripts, documents, and InterForms, and still be addressable by a
single, simple URL. <p>

This directory is ``overlaid'' by your personal Agents directory, <a
href="/My/Agents/">/My/Agents/</a>; this lets you make private versions of any
agent's files.<p>

Also see <a href="/PIA/src/Agents/">/PIA/src/Agents/</a>, which contains
agents of interest to people maintaining the source tree.<p>
