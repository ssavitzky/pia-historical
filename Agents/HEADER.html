<h1>.../pia/Agents</h1>

This directory contains a directory for each category of agents; each agent
or group of closely-related agents is contained in a subdirectory.  This
allows each agent to consist of multiple CGI scripts, documents, and
InterForms, and still be addressable by a single, simple URL. <p>

This directory is ``overlaid'' by your personal Agents directory, <a
href="/My/Agents/">/My/Agents/</a>; this lets you make private versions of any
agent's files.<p>
