<h1>DS -- Data Structures for PIA's</h1>

This directory contains PERL modules for the Agency's fundamental data
structures.   Also see:<p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="../IF/">../IF/</a> for InterForm-related modules
  <li> <a href="../PIA/">../PIA/</a> for agency-related modules
</ul>

Almost everything in the Agency is built using a generic data structure
similar to a PERL object.  It consists of an associative list of
``<dfn>attributes</dfn>'' accessed by name, and an ordered list of
``<dfn>items</dfn>'' accessed by position.<p>

In addition objects may have private attributes whose names start with an
underscore, which are normally accessible only through access functions; these
correspond to ordinary instance variables in object-oriented languages. Many
objects also have named ``<dfn>features</dfn>'' that are computed by lazy
(i.e. as-needed) evaluation.<p>

It is expected that once these data structures are implemented in any
programming language, the rest of the Agency could be translated with very
little effort.  These data structures in turn require strings, extensible
arrays or lists, hash tables or association lists, object wrappers for numbers
and functions, and reference-counted or garbage-collected pointers.  Only
single inheritance is needed.<p>
