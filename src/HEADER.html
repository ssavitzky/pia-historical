This is the top-level directory for source code generated by members of the
PIA Project at CRC.  At the moment it is not clear what will be going in
here, since most of our efforts will be centered on Agents and Agencies, but I
can envision a sizeable stock of shared utilities being developed.  For
example, the REST slide-show CGI and the WebFax software will probably end up
here.<p>
