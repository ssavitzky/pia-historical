<a href="#files">[files]</a><p>

This is the top-level directory for source code (other than PIA <a
href="../Agents">Agents</a>) generated by members of the PIA Project at CRC.
This includes, for example, the Java source code for the PIA itself, tools and
other applications, and so on.<p>

<em>This directory subtree is not included in the PIA binary
distribution.</em> <p>

<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Agents/">Agents/</a>
  <dd> InterForms for agents that are either experimental or used primarily
       for software development.  Other agents are in <a
       href="../Agents/">../Agents/</a> 
  <dt> <a href="app/">app/</a>
  <dd> Separate, stand-alone applications meant to be executed from a command
       line or other shell.  Utilities.
  <dt> <a href="cgi/">cgi/</a>
  <dd> CGI scripts and programs, meant to be installed in
       <code>.../cgi-bin</code> on some server. 
  <dt> <a href="java/">java/</a>
  <dd> Java packages.  (Note that Java does not distinguish between a class
       library and an application, so we can put them all in one place.)
  <dt> <a href="perl/">perl/</a>
  <dd> PERL packages.  (The PERL implementation is obsolete, but will probably
       still run.  You may find it interesting for historical reasons.
       Eventually it would be useful to bring it back up to date.)
</dl>

<h3>Typical Make Targets</h3>

<dl>
  <dt> <code>make all</code>
  <dd> Make all binaries.
  <dt> <code>make doc</code>
  <dd> Make documentation (mainly installed in
       <a href="../Doc"><code>../Doc</code></a> and its subdirectories).
  <dt> <code>make install</code>
  <dd> Install executables in <a href="../bin"><code>pia/bin</code></a>,
       and libraries in 
       <a href="../lib"><code>pia/lib</code></a>.
