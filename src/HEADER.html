<h1>.../pia/src</h1>

This is the top-level directory for source code generated by members of the
PIA Project at CRC.  At the moment it is not clear what will be going in
here, since most of our efforts will be centered on Agents and Agencies, but I
can envision a sizeable stock of shared utilities being developed.  For
example, the REST slide-show CGI and the WebFax software will probably end up
here.<p> 


<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Agencies/">Agencies/</a>
  <dd> Source code for various agencies.  They will eventually install into
       <a href="../pub/">../pub/</a>
  <dt> <a href="Agents/">Agents/</a>
  <dd> Source code and InterForms for the agents.  Each agent is a
       subdirectory. 
  <dt> <a href="app/">app/</a>
  <dd> Separate applications, intended to be installed in /usr/local/bin/ or
       /usr/bin/X11/.  Utilities.
  <dt> <a href="cgi/">cgi/</a>
  <dd> CGI scripts and programs, meant to be installed in .../cgi-bin on some
       server. 
  <dt> <a href="lib/">lib/</a>
  <dd> Libraries intended to be installed in /usr/local/lib or one of its
       subdirectories.   In particular, <a href="lib/perl/">lib/perl/</a>
       contains the PERL code libraries for the only agency that currently
       exists, the one in <a href="Agencies/perl_small/">perl_small/</a>.
</dl>

<h3>Typical Make Targets</h3>

<dl>
  <dt> <code>make public</code>
  <dd> Install a package or ``installation kit'' in <code>.../pia/pub/</code>.
  <dt> <code>make install</code>
  <dd> Install executables in <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>, libraries in
       <code>/usr/local/lib/</code>, and man pages in
       <code>/usr/local/man/</code>. 
</dl>
