<h1>XHTML Tagset</h1>

<doc> This tagset consists of the primitive operations from the <a
      href="basic.html">basic</a> tagset, the additional non-primitive
      convenience functions of <a href="xxml.html">standalone</a>, and
      HTML syntax.  It is intended for use in eXtended HTML documents.
</doc>

This file contains the XML definition for the <code>xhtml</code> Tagset.  It
should be possible to process this file into either documentation or a DTD.
It's concievable that we could even process it into Java. <p>

Note the SGML requirement that the element named in the &lt;!doctype...&gt;
declaration be the outermost element in the document.

<h2>Additional tags for HTML</h2>

At the moment there aren't any.
