  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Parsing:  &lt;tr&gt; gets lost <br>
       &lt;tr&gt; ends the previous &lt;th&gt;, but neither the expected
       &lt;/tr&gt; nor the &lt;tr&gt; show up.  An entity before an inserted
       &lt;/td&gt; also causes havoc -- it turns into a comment! (probably bad
       node type).
       (1998-6-26) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> slides:  &lt;h2&gt; doesn't work <br>
       It produces no output, but the entity doesn't seem to get defined.
       (1998-6-26) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> replaceChild when redefining entity or handler <br>
       BasicTagset and BasicEntityTable have to do a replaceChild when
       replacing a binding.
       (1998-6-26) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Must define tags at parse time to cache trees <br>
       In order to parse correctly, you have to have the whole DTD in
       advance.
       (1998-6-25) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Upgrade <code>handle</code> methods. <br>
       The static <code>handle(<em>element</em>)</code> methods in handler
       subclasses should pick up a static instance if possible, rather than
       just calling <code>new</code>.  (See also ''Impr'' of 1998-06-15.)
       (1998-6-25) <br>

  <li> <b>Goal:</b> (8-1) Run Most Agents <br>
       Be able to run all of the agents in daily use (i.e. history, etc., but
       not the wacko stuff in on the form server).
       (1998-6-24) <br>

  <li> <b>Goal:</b> (7-1) Able to process slides <br>
       Be able to process <code>.../Reviews/slides-199807.html</code> in time
       to show it at the review.  Requires &lt;actor&gt;
       (1998-6-24) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Flag unimplemented legacy options. <br>
       Unimplemented legacy options in &lt;get&gt; etc. have to be brought to
       the user's attention with error messages.  Requires a mode flag or,
       better, dispatching via the legacy handler first.
       (1998-6-24) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Character Entities should be defined in tagset <br>
       Should have defined value; copy value into references to short-circuit
       lookup.  <code>TextUtil.expandCharacterEntities</code> can then make
       use of this.
       (1998-6-22) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> <code>ToParseTree</code> should take a tagset <br>
       Tagset is needed to attach actions to constructed nodes.
       (1998-6-22) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Tagset should extend EntityTable. <br>
       This will make it easier to define entities and tags in the same DTD.
       (1998-6-19) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Character entity class, handler <br>
       Having a separate node class and handler class for character entities
       would simplify inserting and expanding them.  Would break some legacy
       code, though.
       (1998-06-19) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> PUT_VALUE action code needed <br>
       Get a value for the node and put that.  Needs a corresponding
       <code>putValue(<em>node, context, output</em>)</code> in Action; the
       default should be to copy the node.
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> <code>ParseTreeDocument</code> &amp; XML nodes. <br>
       ...are still unimplemented. 
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> PIA transition from old to new interp. <br>
       Agents need to know which interpretor (and tagset, of course) they
       should be using.  Hooks can be distinguished by type.
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> PIA Content in push mode. <br>
       <code>crc.pia.Content</code> currently operates in pull mode, expecting
       to read from an input stream.  For the DPS it needs to run in push
       mode, giving the DPS a suitable output stream and letting it run.
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> PIA namespaces and data types <br>
       During the transition Agent, Transaction, etc. need to be able to
       return both SGML and DOM data as needed.
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Prop:</b> New InterForm extensions (?). <br>
       <dl compact>
	 <dt> .mh
	 <dd> ``Meta-HTML'' -- resulting in a MIME type of
	      <code>text/html</code> 
	 <dt> .mx
	 <dd> ``Meta-XML'' -- resulting in a MIME type appropriate for XML.
	 <dt> .md
	 <dd> ``Meta-Data'' -- the MIME type is computed by the file
	 <dt> .mt
	 <dd> ``Meta-Transaction'' -- the entire headers are computed.
       </dl>
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> ISO 8601 date representation (dashes) <br>
       See <a href="http://www.ft.uni-erlangen.de/~mskuhn/iso-time.html">this
       summary</a>.  The main things needing fixing are the entity table
       initialization, and dates as presented by the History agent's hook.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- Should add timezone and UTC time/date as well.

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Entities need to be initialized by the Tagset. <br>
       The justification for this is that strictly speaking entities are
       defined in the DTD.
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Caching for subProcess stack <br>
       ContextStack should have a <code>free</code> link to a free
       sub-processor, to be used instead of allocating one.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- <code>subProcess</code> clears <code>free</code>; caller does
	  <code>p.cleanup()</code> when finished to restore it.

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> NamedNodeList wrapping a Table <br>
       Want to be able to wrap a Table as a NamedNodeList.  This will provide
       the DPS equivalent of <code>crc.sgml.AttrWrap</code>.
       (1998-06-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> tag handler classes need loader methods <br>
       Tagset shouldn't have to know how to load classes for handlers.  Having
       static methods for this would allow tag handlers to manage their own
       name spaces. 
       (1998-06-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Check:</b>  copying <br>
       Non-processed parse trees (e.g. &lt;else&gt;) should never be copied.
       Copying should use <code>putNode</code> if the node actually has
       children; recursion if the children are unparsed.
       (1998-06-15)<br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> <code>Filter</code> parse tree input <br> 
       Filter should  be able to read a serialized parse tree.
       (1998-06-15) <br>
       -- It should do so if the input file ends in ``<code>.obj</code>''.
       
  <li> <b>Query:</b>  &lt;test zero&gt; non-number&lt;/&gt; = ?<br>
       Not clear whether non-numerics should test as zero or not.  The most
       consistant thing would be for whitespace to return <code>true</code>,
       non-whitespace to return <code>false</code>.
       (1998-06-15)

       (1998-06-15) <br>
       <b>done:</b> subst if else then test

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> New Handlers <br>
       <br>
       <b>done:</b> subst if else then elsf test

  <li> <b>Check:</b> attribute and tag case sensitivity <br>
       Nothing is careful about cannonical attribute and tag names yet.

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> <code>NamedActiveNode</code> values <br>
       Named nodes should have defined, assigned and default values. Only
       defined value should be the children; it would be used for the
       <em>definition</em> of a name.  Want to be able to share assigned
       values; the NodeList of an assigned value would be a copy (just like we
       presently do for attribute lists, and for the same reason). 

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> <code>BasicParser</code>: content parse control <br>
       Currently Parser does not check syntax of current node to see whether
       to look for entities or elements in the content.
       <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> <code>SGMLParser</code>: content models <br>
       Currently Parsers and Tagsets do not have any notion of content model.
       <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> <code>ParseTreeElement</code> hasActiveAttributes <br>
       ParseTreeElement should keep information about whether any of its
       attributes contain entities that need to be expanded.  Should be much
       faster, since most don't and it's known at parse time. <p>

       The other possibility is lazy evaluation -- don't even look at them
       until they're needed when converting an attribute's value to a string.<p>
       <br>

  <li> <b>Wish:</b> <code>toNextNode</code>  <br>
       Might want flag in Input's that tells whether the current node has been
       processed yet.  (really relevant only for toNextNode, to keep track of
       whether we've enumerated the children yet)
       <br>

  <li> <b>Wish:</b> <code>ParseTreeIterator</code> <br>
       We will want a ParseTreeIterator that implements both Input and
       Output (and of course TreeIterator).  The main use would be
       constructing an node and then processing it.
       <br>

  <li> <b>Wish:</b> <code>ParseTreeGenericNode</code> <br>
       Eventually there should be a ParseTreeGenericNode, basically Token, so
       that we can build trees with arbitrary node types.
       <br>
