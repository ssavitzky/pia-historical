<ol>
  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Some &lt;select&gt; subs unimplemented. <br>
       Needs to implement everything in XPointer spec, at least.
       (1998-09-08)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> XML empty flag not recognized <br>
       At least on &lt;for&gt; elements.
       (1998-09-04) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Entity definitions. <br>
       &lt;define entity&gt; unimplemented.
       (1998-09-03) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> PIA datatype transition. <br>
       During the transition Agent and Transaction need to be able to
       return both SGML and DOM data as needed.  Fortunately most of the
       namespaces contain only strings; it's really only hooks that differ.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- Make Agent and Transaction implement an interface with methods
	  like <code>getObjectAt</code> and <code>getStringAt</code>,
	  etc. instead of the Attr interface; sort it out in the handlers.

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Entities need work.  Tagset, passive entities. <br>
       Passive entities (character entities) and some normal entities have to
       be defined in the DTD.  Passive entities untested. 
       (1998-08-13) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Parser work needed. <br>
       Literals, CDATA sections, parent, content models, declaration and PI
       parsing, optionally splitting text into tokens, optional case-munging.
       <code>retainTree</code> implemented (08-27) but untested.
       (1998-08-13) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Attribute definitions. <br>
       Attribute types, implied/fixed/etc., default values, handlers.
       Dispatch table for attrs with handlers.  Lazy evaluation(?) 
       (1998-08-13)

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Interface to push-mode parsers <br>
       Most parsers operate in push mode -- they read their input and call a
       semantic handler for each ``event''.  This requires running the
       Processor in a separate thread.
       (1998-08-13)<br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Text Substitution<p>
       Needs to be done using either &lt;select&gt; or its own &lt;subst&gt;
       element with appropriate sub-elements.
       (1998-08-12)<br>
       -- (1998/08/26) handler written but no sub-elements yet.

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Tagsets don't hack resource names correctly. <br>
       Need to decide between Class and ClassLoader conventions.  ClassLoader
       requires slashes; Class prepends module name.  Need the prepend, then
       change dots to slashes (probably in <code>crc.util.NameUtils</code>).
       (1998-08-12)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Loading tagset from file should use resource. <br>
       <code>ClassLoader.getSystemResource</code> should do the right thing.
       (1998-08-12)<br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> <code>isChildOf</code> unused in parser. <br>
       (1998-08-12)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Need constructor for stripped tagsets. <br>
       Best done with a predefined tagset (STRIP_ts). 
       (1998-08-07)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Can't <em>use</em> a tagset. <br>
       The &lt;tagset&gt; tag only really works in a tagset definition file.
       (1998-08-11)<br>
       -- Possibly best done using a separate useTagset handler.

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Rename TextHandler to avoid case conflict. <br>
       Rename to TextNodeHandler to avoid Windows conflict with textHandler.
       (1998-08-07)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Handler class hierarchy problems. <br>
       There are two many places where we assume that all real handlers
       inherit from BasicHandler.  Fix one way or the other.
       (1998-08-13)<br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Functional programming tools. <br>
       See <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/tut/functional.html">Python</a>
       (1998-08-05)<br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Namespace changes needed. <br>
       Tagset wants to extend Namespace (sigh).  Index -&gt; namespace.
       Changes in &lt;get&gt;, &lt;set&gt;, etc.
       (1998-08-05)<br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Major changes needed for new DOM. <br>
       Do this after Level 1 stabilizes.  May involve moving interfaces from
       <code>crc.dps.active</code> to <code>crc.dom</code>, and the original
       <code>Node</code> interface (etc.) to the official location in
       <code>org.w3c.dom</code>.
       (1998-08-05)<br>

  <li> <b>Check:</b> entity-reference termination in InterForms <br>
       The old parser accepts entity references without a closing semicolon.
       The new one doesn't.
       (1998-07-23)<br>       

  <li> <b>Note:</b> The official package name is <code>org.w3c.dom</code> <br>
       Not clear at this point exactly what use to make of this.
       (1998-07-16)<br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> PI comments <br>
       Comments of the form <code>&lt;?-- text ?&gt;</code> should be discarded
       by the processor rather than being copied.
       (1998-07-15)<br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> PI and declaration actions <br>
       Need to assign separate actions to PI's and declarations by name.
       As a desirable side effect, this will allow loading tagsets and
       interpreting DTD's.  Strictly speaking the name is the name of an
       application, not of an operation.  PI's may have to be handled <em>even
       when passively copying</em>!
       (1998-07-15)<br>
       <p>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Node construction <em>must</em> set handler. <br>
       All new nodes have to have their handler set properly; this means
       replacing almost all <code>new ParseTree<em>Whatever</em></code> with
       <code>create<em>Whatever</em></code> operations on the current
       Tagset. Easily enforced by eliminating constructors without handlers.
       (1998-07-10)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> ProcessedContent doesn't do insertions. <br>
       Neither does its predecessor, InterFormContent.
       (1998-07-08) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Need <code>lookupFile(fn, write)</code> in TopContext. <br>
       (1998-07-08) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Add ActiveNode operations to <code>Input</code>, etc. <br>
       Fully supporting <code>ActiveNode</code> as well as <code>Node</code>
       everywhere in the DPS would give faster, simpler code.  It is already
       impossible to use ordinary DOM Nodes in a Processor.
       (1998-07-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Parser should put text in <code>next</code> <br>
       (instead of putting it in <code>nextText</code> and increasing the
       number of tests per token).
       (1998-06-29) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Ought to have <code>NamedChildList</code> <br>
       for the children of things like <code>EntityTable</code> and
       <code>Tagset</code>.
       (1998-06-29) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> appending to undefined entity fails. <br>
       &lt;set name=foo&gt;&lt;get name=foo&gt;...&lt;/set&gt; leaves
       <code>foo</code> undefined.  There must be an explanation...
       (1998-06-26) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Upgrade <code>handle</code> methods. <br>
       The static <code>handle(<em>element</em>)</code> methods in handler
       subclasses should pick up a static instance if possible, rather than
       just calling <code>new</code>.  (See also ''Impr'' of 1998-06-15.)
       (1998-06-25) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> <code>ToParseTree</code> should take a tagset <br>
       Tagset is needed to attach actions to constructed nodes.
       (1998-06-22) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Tagset should extend EntityTable, or reference one. <br>
       This will make it easier to define entities and tags in the same DTD.
       (1998-06-19) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> PUT_VALUE action code needed <br>
       Get a value for the node and put that.  Needs a corresponding
       <code>putValue(<em>node, context, output</em>)</code> in Action; the
       default should be to copy the node.  Could be used for entity expansion
       in attributes.
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> <code>ParseTreeDocument</code>, DTD, &amp; XML nodes. <br>
       ...are still unimplemented. 
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> ISO 8601 date representation (dashes) <br>
       See <a href="http://www.ft.uni-erlangen.de/~mskuhn/iso-time.html">this
       summary</a>.  The main things needing fixing are the entity table
       initialization, and dates as presented by the History agent's hook.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- Should add timezone and UTC time/date as well.

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Caching for subProcess stack <br>
       ContextStack should have a <code>free</code> link to a free
       sub-processor, to be used instead of allocating one.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- <code>subProcess</code> clears <code>free</code>; caller does
	  <code>p.cleanup()</code> when finished to restore it.

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> NamedNodeList wrapping a Table <br>
       Want to be able to wrap a Table as a NamedNodeList.  This will provide
       the DPS equivalent of <code>crc.sgml.AttrWrap</code>.
       (1998-06-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> <code>Filter</code> parse tree input <br> 
       Filter should  be able to read a serialized parse tree.
       (1998-06-15) <br>
       -- It should do so if the input file ends in ``<code>.xho</code>'' or
          ``<code>.xxo</code>''.
       
  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Legacy Handlers <br>
       <code>cd <a href="../interform/handle">../interform/handle</a>;
       make dps-check </code> for report.
       (1998-06-15) <br>
       -- now largely abandoned.

  <li> <b>Check:</b> attribute and tag case sensitivity <br>
       Nothing is careful about cannonical attribute and tag names yet.

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> <code>NamedActiveNode</code> values <br>
       Named nodes should have defined, assigned and default values. Only
       defined value should be the children; it would be used for the
       <em>definition</em> of a name.  Want to be able to share assigned
       values; the NodeList of an assigned value would be a copy (just like we
       presently do for attribute lists, and for the same reason). 

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> <code>ParseTreeElement</code> hasActiveAttributes <br>
       ParseTreeElement should keep information about whether any of its
       attributes contain entities that need to be expanded.  Should be much
       faster, since most don't and it's known at parse time.
       The other possibility is lazy evaluation -- don't even look at them
       until they're needed when converting an attribute's value to a string.
       <br>

  <li> <b>Wish:</b> <code>ParseTreeIterator</code> <br>
       We will want a ParseTreeIterator that implements both Input and
       Output (and of course TreeIterator).  The main use would be
       constructing an node and then processing it.
