<h2>Cleanup and refactoring</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Move Piaproperties to <code>ds</code>; rename.
  <li> Make a generic Tabular wrapper similar to Piaproperties.  Use for,
       e.g., attribute lists.
  <li> Rename Tabular to StringMap
  <li> Use StringMap interface for headers, etc.
</ol>

<h2>Main List</h2>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> Interface Cleanup <br>
       Make most attributes conform to get/set convention instead of the
       legacy perl convention.  Remove most convenience methods,
       e.g. the ones that set criteria, etc.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> GenericAgent.findInterform needs extension list. <br>
       Actually, finding files ought to be in a utility class, because you
       need to get out: the file pathname, the URL path, and the part of the
       URL after the file that was found (which gets passed to the
       interform). 
       (1998-10-13) <br>
       
  <li> <b>Bug</b> no namespace for all installed agents. <br>
       (1998-10-12) <br>
       
  <li> <b>Hole:</b> PIA datatype transition. <br>
       During the transition Agent and Transaction need to be able to
       return both SGML and DOM data as needed.  Fortunately most of the
       namespaces contain only strings; it's really only hooks that differ.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- Make Agent and Transaction implement an interface with methods
	  like <code>getObjectAt</code> and <code>getStringAt</code>,
	  etc. instead of the Attr interface; sort it out in the handlers.

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> ProcessedContent doesn't do insertions. <br>
       Neither does its predecessor, InterFormContent.
       (1998-07-08) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> ISO 8601 date representation (dashes) <br>
       See <a href="http://www.ft.uni-erlangen.de/~mskuhn/iso-time.html">this
       summary</a>.  The main things needing fixing are the entity table
       initialization, and dates as presented by the History agent's hook.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- Should add timezone and UTC time/date as well.
