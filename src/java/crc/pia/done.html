  <li> 1998-10-?? <b>Bug</b> GenericAgent.findInterform needs extension list.
       <br>
       Actually, finding files ought to be in a utility class, because you
       need to get out: the file pathname, the URL path, and the part of the
       URL after the file that was found (which gets passed to the
       interform).

  <li> 1998-10-30 <b>Hole:</b> PIA datatype transition. <br>
       During the transition Agent and Transaction need to be able to
       return both SGML and DOM data as needed.  Fortunately most of the
       namespaces contain only strings; it's really only hooks that differ.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- Make Agent and Transaction implement an interface with methods
	  like <code>getObjectAt</code> and <code>getStringAt</code>,
	  etc. instead of the Attr interface; sort it out in the handlers.
       
  <li> 1998-10-30 <b>Bug</b> DPS hooks aren't executed <br>
       (1998-10-28)<br>

  <li> 1999-01-04 <b>Hole</b> <code>handle</code> subdir for tag handlers <br>
       Agent-specific handlers are in Agent.
