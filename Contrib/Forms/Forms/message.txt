Subject:  Pending forms

Hello, 
This message is to inform you that your electronic signature has been
requested by one or more forms. For links to the forms that require your
signature, go to http://forms.crc.ricoh.com:8000/Forms/users.if and click on your
username.

Questions and comments should be mailed to kevin@crc.ricoh.com or
wolff@crc.ricoh.com.

Thank you.

(Users are notified twice a day when they have pending forms.  Eventually
the frequency will be under individual user control.  Thank you for your
patience during the upgrade to the new forms processing system.)
