
<h2>Asset_Transfer form</h2>

RSV works hard to get the most out of its capital assets, and has been generally successful in identifying
good uses for underutilized assets.   Now that we are a real company, there is actually an economic
incentive for groups to identify these opportunities as associated depreciation costs move with the asset.
<p>
This form is used to allow better tracking of such asset movements from one division or department to another.

This is a default template for forms.
Variable to be filled out should be specified with formvariable tags as
below:
 <table>
<tr><th>Employee</th><th>Simple Value to be entered</th><th>List of values to choose</th></tr>
<tr><td> <formvariable name="employee" options="users"> </formvariable>
    </td><td> <formvariable name="simplevalue"> </formvariable>
    </td><td> <formvariable name="choicevalue" options="choice1 choice2">
         </formvariable>
</td></tr>
 </table>
Sums and other combinations of variables can also be added, see other forms
for examples.
