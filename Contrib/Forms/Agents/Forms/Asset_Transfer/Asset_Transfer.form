
<h2>Asset_Transfer form</h2>

RSV works hard to get the most out of its capital assets, and has been generally successful in identifying
good uses for underutilized equipment.   Now that we are a real company, there is actually an economic
incentive for groups to identify these opportunities as associated depreciation costs move with the asset.
This form is used to allow better tracking of such asset movements from one division or department to another.

Once received by accounting, this form should be rerouted to the head of the receiving department.  Once signed off, accounting makes final approval and reassigns the asset to the new department in the accounting system.
