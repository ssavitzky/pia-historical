New Form Creation Instructions: 

(1) Create a new directory with the form name at the following location:
    /home/dgillen/.pia/Agents/Forms     
    Example:
     cd /home/dgillen/.pia/Agents/Forms
     mkdir timecard

(2) Create two interform files in the new directory. The first uses only standard html
commands to create a form with entry fields and their associated names (PIA commands,
although not needed, can be used as well). The only important thing to know is that the name 
associated with the entry field for the person filling out the form should ALWAYS be 
the word "name" in lower case. The "action" of this file occurs on the second file, 
whose purpose is to process the entered data. The process file must include the following 
lines in this order:

     -Set an entity named "dir" to the name of the directory that was just created.
       Example:
       <set entity name=dir>timecard</set>

     -Set an entity named "dataobject" to an easily readable data-structure containing ALL 
     of the form field data along with accompanying descriptions of each field.
       Example:
       <set entity name=dataobject><dl><dt><b>Name:</b><dd><u>&FORM.name;</u>
       <dt><b>Pay period number:</b><dd><u>&FORM.paydate;</u>
       <dt><b>Exceptions:</b><dd><u>&FORM.exceptions;</u>
       <dt><b>Dates:</b><dd><u>&FORM.dates;</u></dl></set>
    
     -Include the following lines exactly as they appear:
       <set entity name=mlist><read file="mgr.dat" process></set>    
       <set entity name=manager><get name="mlist.&FORM.name;"></set>

      -Set an entity named "routeobject" to a data list containing the routing information.
       It should model the following pattern: 
      <dl><dt>1st person to sign <dd>2nd person to sign
          <dt>2nd person to sign <dd>3rd person to sign 
              ...
          <dt>last person to sign <dd>NULL</dl>
       The first person to sign is ALWAYS the original person to fill out the form,
       namely "&FORM.name;". Other possible signers are other users, "&manager;",
       "FrontOffice" , "Accounting" , "Auditor" , and "Purchasing".
        Example:
        <set entity name=routeobject><dl><dt>&FORM.name;<dd>FrontOffice
        <dt>FrontOffice<dd>&manager;<dt>&manager;<dd>NULL</dl></set>
    
       -Include the following lines exactly as they appear:
        <set entity name=timesec>&time;:&second;</set> 
        <read interform file="write.inc" process>

Misc. Info:

The data that is both used and stored by the forms that you create is located 
in the following directory: /home/dgillen/.pia/Forms/. Global data is stored directly
in /Forms, while form-specific data is located in that forms' particular directory 
within /Forms. Each form-specific directory for data contains a series of subdirectories 
that are automatically created based on the date of the form submission. There is also 
an html-based report within each subdirectory which contains links to all of the data 
files within its child directories.

Here are descriptions of the global data files:

account_types.dat
   -list of possible account types

acct_codes.dat
   -corresponding account number for each account type

kiansho.dat
   -single digit which kiansho form uses to serialize requests

message.txt
   -message that is mailed by emailer to inform a user of pending requests

mgr.dat
   -corresponding manager for each username

namelist.dat
   -list of all usernames (employees)

numlist2.dat
   -used by purchasereq to make code more consise

paydate.dat
   -list of possible paydates (used by the timecard form)

purchasereq.dat
   -single digit which purhcasereq form uses to serialize requests

usertodept.dat
   -corresponding department number for each username

usertoext.dat
   -corresponding extension number for each username

usertoname.dat
   -corresponding full name for each username
