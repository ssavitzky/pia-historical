 Sometimes a user should be notified only when some form entry meets a
 condition.  To specify this type of a route entry, choose
 <code>onlyif</code> as the "when" for an entry then (after submitting) you
 will be given a chance to enter a condition.  An example might be to route to
 a user only if a variable named "var1" was greater than $1000  -- that
 condition would be specified
 <code>&lt;test positive&gt;&lt;difference&gt; &amp;var1; 1000 &lt;/difference&gt;&lt;test&gt;</code>

<p>
Otherwise specify "always" under when to always route to a user or "never" to
effectively remove a user from a route.
