Statement of Understanding:<p>
In the event an employee who resigns or is terminated has a negative vacation balance (i.e. the employee has used more vacation time than was accrued through the date of termination), the amout due the company will be deducted from any monies due the employee. Should the amount due the company exceed the amount due the employee, the employee shall refund the excess to the company.<p>
