<h1>.../pia/Contrib</h1>

This directory is for software, especially configuration files, contributed by
PIA users and developers. <p>

<em>The contents of this directory are not an official part of the PIA
distribution, but are included in the hope that they will make it more
useful.</em><p>

Each directory in this subtree corresponds to a site, and each directory under
that to a user.  Under each user, the ``<code>my/</code>'' subdirectory
contains the contents of the that user's PIA state directory
(``<code>~/.pia/</code>'' on Unix systems) -- the name is changed to avoid
having special characters in the names.  Other configuration files, if the
user chooses to put them here, are <em>not</em> renamed. <p>
