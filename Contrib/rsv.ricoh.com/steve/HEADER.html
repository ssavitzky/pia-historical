<h2>Notes:</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="my/HEADER.html">my/HEADER.html</a>
       is a sort of ``quick-reference'' page of links to pages I'm always
       using, so I customized the <code>cia</code> and <code>fbi</code> agents
       to put a link ([~] to it on the banner.
  <li> Similarly, [!] and [?] are links to a (larger) quick-reference page and
       a form in my usual home directory (which I really ought to redo for the
       PIA now).
  <li> <a href="my/Agents/Agency/insert.if">my/Agents/Agency/insert.if</a>
       links to a picture of me.  I don't really care to see my mug every time
       I look at my Agency's root page, but it's useful if anyone else browses
       to it.
  <li> <a href="my/Agents/InterForm/test.if">my/Agents/InterForm/test.if</a>
       is of course customized for testing whatever bug I happen to be working
       on at the time.
