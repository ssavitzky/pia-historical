New Form Creation Instructions: 

(Most of these instructions require the user to be a member of the admin group.)
(1) Use <a href="create_form.if"> the create form page</a> to create a new
    form directory and template.
(2) <a href="edit_form.if">Edit</a> the newly created form, and the
corresponding <a href="edit_route.if">route</a>.
(3) Re-initialize the server to add the form to the list of forms.

Forms can include any html tags (except the "form" tag).  They should also
include some special tags -- "form-variable" indicates a value which should be
filled out, while "form-protect" indicates a value which should be derived
from other values (for example a sum), and "references" indicates a place to
specify arbitrary URL's related to the filled out form.  See existing forms for examples.

Misc. Info:

The data that is both used and stored by the forms that you create is located 
in the following directory: ROOTDIR/Forms/ (where ROOTDIR is
/pc-mac/admin/piaforms for the RSV system). Global data is stored directly
in /Forms, while form-specific data is located in that forms' particular directory 
within /Forms. Each form-specific directory for data contains a series of subdirectories 
that are automatically created based on the date of the form submission. There is also 
an html-based report within each subdirectory which contains links to all of the data 
files within its child directories.

The blank forms themselves are stored in
ROOTDIR/Agents/Forms/FORMNAME/FORMNAME.form
where FORMNAME is the name or type of the form.

Here are descriptions of the global data files:

users.dat
