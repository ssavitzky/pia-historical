The kiosk agent is used for developing and maintaining the pages associated
with an information kiosk.

Note that while the actual pages may be viewed through other mechanisms (e.g. using
the Apache Web server instead of the PIA server).  In that case, some of the
special features may not be available (for example forms submission).
