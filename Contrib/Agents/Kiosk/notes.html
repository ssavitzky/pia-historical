other plausible options:

<ul>
<li>link for adding sound annotations should include direct entry of speech
(the microphone) if the user is using a browser on the media board itself
<li>digital camera can be used to take pictures (e.g. for directions or icons)
which are then transferred directly onto the media board
<li>show video and audio clips
<li>special messages
<li>the source for any page can come from any other url and will be
automatically updated whenever that URL changes
</ul>
